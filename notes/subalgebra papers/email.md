Hey Andrew,

Apologies for the delay — Singapore was a blur of activity (mainly eating), got in to Tokyo this morning and am settled down now for at least a few days. Not precisely sure what our next plans are. We have a flight booked to Sapporo on Tuesday, but given their massive earthquake earlier this week it’s not clear if that will work. So may be Tokyo-bound for a bit longer. Anyway, on to the good stuff:

> what you've been doing is computing ranks at the level of the cobracket (using the cobracket integrability condition), and the check that A2 is a basis through E6 was that all such solutions (with clustery cobracket) can be decomposed into A2 functions.

Precisely. In brute force terms, the check is:

1) start with an ansatz of \sum_{i,j} C22[i,j] {xi}_2 \wedge {xj}_2 + C31[i,j] {xi}_3 \otimes xj, where i & j span all X-coordinates for an algebra,

2) impose cobracket integrability on the above ansatz and count the number of linearly independent solutions,

3) then compare against the number of linearly independent A2 functions on that same algebra,

4) and the claim is that these numbers are equal for all algebras <= E6.

No, I haven’t seen that before! Very interesting. Goncharov told me that classical Li_k + Li_{2,2} formed a basis for weight 4 and that was all I needed to hear ;).

I will contribute more to the paper for sure over the next few days while in Tokyo. As always, if you have specifics you want me to work on let me know. I like your changes to 2.2 and will put in some thought to 2.5 and 2.6. Maybe tomorrow I will mess around with some typesetting options. 

Enough about writing, now to the fun stuff — reading :) Many thanks for the audible info, I will give that a try soon. Didn’t get beyond the Kindle free sample portion of The Quiet American in Singapore, but it’s next up. Also, I forgot to mention a book I read earlier this summer that I think might pass as a fun quickie for you: At the Existentialist Cafe, by Sarah Bakewell. She’s the one who wrote the intro to Montaigne I felll in love with back in 2012 (titled How To Live). I enjoyed this new-ish book by her introducing existentialism, and am feeling motivated to read some of the classics which weren’t covered in my 20th c. European Thought class (specifically Beauvoir). I specifically resonated with her description of Heidegger’s philosophy as one that doesn’t provide much space to “live in” as a regular person. And I did not appreciate the intensity of Sartre’s life, particularly in the latter half (it was news to me that he averaged 20pgs of published material per day over the course of his life). Anyway, if you’re looking for something easy I’d suggest this, and would love to hear your thoughts on it.  

Cheers,

john
