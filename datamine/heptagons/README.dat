This folder contains the 2-loop MHV and NMHV heptagon amplitudes, written in the 
conventions of 1612.08976. Thus, EMHV encodes the BDS-like normalized MHV amplitude 
while  E0, E47, and E67 multiply the tree amplitude, (47), and (67), respectively, in 
the NHMH amplitudes, where (ij) denotes the R-invariant not involving indices i or j.
Omega A corresponds to the double pentagon integral with one additional leg coming 
out of the end of one of the pentagons, while Omega B corresponds to the double 
pentagon integral with one additional leg coming from one of the vertices shared 
by the two pentagons. Note that these functions are probably in mixed coupling 
conventions, i.e. some correspond to perturbatively expanding in the coupling 'a', 
while others correspond to expanding in 'g^2'. The difference between the two is a 
factor of 4.
