This folder contains the 2-loop MHV and NMHV hexaong amplitudes, written in the 
conventions of 1509.08127. Thus, EMHV encodes the BDS-like normalized MHV amplitude 
while E and Etilde multiply (1)+(4) and (1)-(4) respectively, where (i) denotes the 
R-invariant not involving index i. The two-loop omega function is also provided,
and 

[[[post even/odd parts of omegaTilde!]]]. 

Note that these functions are probably in mixed coupling 
conventions, i.e. some correspond to perturbatively expanding in the coupling 'a', 
while others correspond to expanding in 'g^2'. The difference between the two is a 
factor of 4.
