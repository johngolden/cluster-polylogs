Physical Properties/Restricted Behaviors of interest:
 - Bose Symmetry
 - Branch cuts
 - Extended Steinmann relations (restricting multiple quantities at 8 points and above)
 - (Multi-)collinear limits (well-defined and with specific targets)
 - Regge limits
 - Qbar equation
 - (Single-valuedness?)
 
Mathematical Properties of interest:
 - Cosmic Galois Theory restrictions on the poisson bracket?
 - 
 
 
 - is the 'cluster first entry condition' precisely the Steinmann condition on the second entry?!? 
 - check that these arguments map you into the space Steinmann weight two classical polylogs in the heptagon case
 - how does this manifest for n>=8, where there are nontrivial conversions between different BDS-like normalized quantities?
 - so is it true that cluster X-coordinates somehow give arguments to (at least classical) polylogarithms such that they 
 automatically satisfy steinmann?


 - the remainder function vanishes at one loop (or weight 2). So naively, the Steinmann conditions shouldn't translate back to
 this space directly. But the cobracket is precisely killing the products of Steinmann functions (here just logs) that would lead 
 to non-Steinmann functions, thus we remain in the Steinmann space (at least at this weight)
 - by killing all products, the cobracket has to satisfy ALL versions of the Steinmann relations simultaneously (right?)
