\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Many of the recent advances in our understanding of scattering amplitudes have come from studying explicit examples. This has been especially true in the planar limit of ${\cal N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills (sYM) theory~\cite{Brink:1976bc,Gliozzi:1976qd}, where nontrivial amplitudes have been computed through seven loops~\cite{CaronHuot:2011kk,Dixon:2014iba,Drummond:2014ffa,Dixon:2015iva,Caron-Huot:2016owq,Dixon:2016nkn,Drummond:2018caf,Caron-Huot:2019vjl,Caron-Huot:2020bkp,Dixon:2020cnr}, certain form factors have been computed through five loops~\cite{Brandhuber:2012vm,Dixon:2020bbt}, and methods exist for calculating the symbols of several classes of two-loop amplitudes to all particle multiplicities~\cite{CaronHuot:2011ky,Zhang:2019vnm,He:2020vob}. With the benefit of this concrete data, a number of unexpected analytic~\cite{Caron-Huot:2016owq,Caron-Huot:2019bsq}, cluster-algebraic~\cite{Golden:2013xva,Golden:2014pua,Golden:2014xqa,Drummond:2017ssj,Drummond:2019cxm,Arkani-Hamed:2019rds,Henke:2019hve,Mago:2019waa,Gurdogan:2020tip,Mago:2020eua}, number-theoretic~\cite{Caron-Huot:2019bsq}, and positivity~\cite{Arkani-Hamed:2014dca,Dixon:2016apl} properties have been discovered, which have in turn stimulated the development of increasingly advanced computational techniques. The success of these explorations clearly motivates the further study of amplitudes involving eight and more particles, especially as new algebraic and analytic features are known to arise in these higher-point amplitudes. 
% (some of which, notably, seem to generalize to non-supersymmetric quantum field theories~\cite{Anastasiou:2013srw,Panzer:2016snt,Schnetz:2017bko,Abreu:2020jxa}). 

Only a few results involving eight or more particles at weak coupling are known in planar $\mathcal{N} = 4$ sYM theory beyond one loop. Most notably, these include the symbols of the two-loop maximally-helicity-violating (MHV) and next-to-MHV (NMHV) amplitudes, which can be computed at any multiplicity using the methods of~\cite{CaronHuot:2011ky,Zhang:2019vnm,He:2020vob}. The two-loop MHV amplitude has also been explored numerically, and in special kinematic configurations corresponding to regular polygons~\cite{DelDuca:2010zp,Heslop:2010kq,Gaiotto:2010fk}. Beyond this, only a handful of Feynman integrals involving more than seven particles are known~\cite{Bourjaily:2018aeq,Henn:2018cdp,He:2020uxy,He:2020lcu,Bourjaily:2021lnz}. 

In this paper, we focus on the two-loop MHV amplitudes in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ sYM theory for eight and nine particles. Once normalized in the infrared by the BDS ansatz~\cite{Bern:2005iz}, these amplitudes respect both a superconformal symmetry and a dual superconformal symmetry~\cite{Drummond:2007au,Drummond:2006rz,Bern:2006ew,Bern:2007ct,Alday:2007he}, the latter of which is naturally associated with light-like polygonal Wilson loops to which these amplitudes are dual~\cite{Drummond:2007au,Alday:2007hr,Drummond:2007aua,Brandhuber:2007yx,Drummond:2007cf,Bern:2008ap,Drummond:2008aq}. The finite part of the $n$-particle amplitude is then encoded in the remainder function $R_n$, which depends only on dual-conformally-invariant (DCI) cross-ratios of Mandelstam invariants and smoothly deforms to the lower-point remainder function $R_{n{-}1}$ in collinear limits.

The symbols of the two-loop eight- and nine-particle remainder functions were computed in~\cite{CaronHuot:2011ky} and are known to exhibit a number of intriguing cluster-algebraic properties. For instance, their logarithmic branch points all coincide with the vanishing loci of cluster coordinates in $\Gr(4,n)$~\cite{Golden:2013xva}, while their Lie cobrackets can be written in terms of Bloch group elements that (termwise) involve only cluster coordinates that appear together in clusters of $\Gr(4,n)$~\cite{Golden:2014pua}. Additionally, the most complicated component of their cobracket---the component encoding the nonclassical part of these functions---can be expressed entirely in terms of simple polylogarithms associated with the $A_2$ or $A_3$ subalgebras of $\Gr(4,n)$~\cite{Golden:2014xqa}. It is further expected that the remaining (nonclassical) contributions to these remainder functions should be expressible in terms of classical polylogarithms with negative cluster coordinate arguments~\cite{Golden:2014xqf}; however, their full functional form has for many years remained uncomputed. 

In this paper, we leverage these special cluster-algebraic properties to determine the full analytic form of the eight and nine particle amplitudes---the first complete two-loop amplitudes known in this theory for these numbers of particles. We do this using the techniques developed in~\cite{Golden:2014xqa,Golden:2014xqf,Golden:2018gtk,Golden:2019kks}, which involve matching the various components of the remainder function that take different functional forms to appropriate ans\"atze. The terms involving transcendental constants can be determined from knowledge of the differentials of these remainder functions~\cite{CaronHuot:2011ky,Golden:2013lha} and by taking collinear limits to compare to known lower-multiplicity results. 

As part of this analysis, we investigate whether the nonclassical parts of the eight- and nine-particle remainder functions can be decomposed into functions associated with the larger subalgebras of $\Gr(4,8)$ and $\Gr(4,9)$. In~\cite{Golden:2018gtk}, it was shown that the nonclassical part of the seven-particle remainder function could be decomposed into functions associated with the $A_4$, $A_5$, and $D_5$ subalgebras of $\Gr(4,7)$, in addition to the $A_2$ and $A_3$ decompositions found in~\cite{Golden:2014xqa}. We find here that the eight-particle remainder function can be uniquely decomposed in terms of the same $A_5$ function that the seven-particle remainder function was decomposable into, and that the two-loop contribution to $R_{n<10}$ admits a unique decomposition in terms of the function $f_{A_3}^{+-}$ defined in~\cite{Golden:2014xqa}, which has a different signature under the $A_3$ automorphism group than the original $A_3$ function identified in~\cite{Golden:2014xqa}. This leads us to expect that there exists a unique decomposition in terms of $f_{A_3}^{+-}$ at all $n$.

We also make use of our new expressions to explore the behavior of the remainder function numerically. We focus on the dihedrally-symmetric point that exists in the positive region at each particle multiplicity, and plot the behavior of the remainder function as one moves from this symmetric point into successive collinear limits, all the way down to five-point kinematics. This allows us to see the remainder function smoothly limiting to the appropriate lower-point values along multiple lines, providing a cross-check on our results. 
 
This paper is organized as follows...

%In section~\ref{sec:amplitudes_review} we review the structure of amplitudes in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ sYM theory, and in section~\ref{sec:motivic_aspects_polylogs} we describe the polylogarithmic technology we will make use of. We then recall the cluster ~\ref{sec:cluster_algebraic_structure}. In sec

\section{Amplitudes in Planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ sYM Theory}
\label{sec:amplitudes_review}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We begin by recalling some facts about scattering amplitudes in planar $\mathcal{N} = 4$ sYM theory. In addition to positive- and negative-helicity gluons, this theory involves six scalars and four fermions of each helicity. These fields all transform in the adjoint representation of the $SU(N)$ gauge group, and can be combined into on-shell superfields 
\begin{equation}
\Phi = G^+ + \eta^A \Gamma_A + \frac{1}{2!} \eta^A \eta^B S_{AB} + \frac{1}{3!} \eta^A \eta^B \eta^C \epsilon_{ABCD} \overline{\Gamma}^D + \frac{1}{4!} \eta^A \eta^B \eta^C \eta^D \epsilon_{ABCD} G^-\, ,
\end{equation}
where $G^\pm$ denote positive- and negative-helicity gluons, $\Gamma_A$ and $\smash{\overline{\Gamma}^A}$ identify gluinos and anti-gluinos, and $\smash{S_{AB} = \frac{1}{2} \epsilon_{ABCD} \overline{S}^{CD}}$ represent complex scalars. The R-symmetry indices on these on-shell states transform in the fundamental  representation of $SU(4)$, and are contracted with Gra{\ss}mann variables $\eta^A$ and the Levi-Civita tensor $\epsilon_{ABCD}$. In terms of superfields, amplitudes with different field content can be combined into a single superamplitude $\mathcal{A}_n(\Phi_1,\dots,\Phi_n)$, which naturally stratifies into sectors in which helicity conservation is violated by differing amounts. Namely, 
\begin{align}
\mathcal{A}_n = \mathcal{A}_n^{\text{MHV}} +  \mathcal{A}_n^{\text{NMHV}}  \dots + \mathcal{A}_n^{\overline{\text{MHV}}} \, ,
\end{align}
where the component $\mathcal{A}^{\text{N$^{k}$MHV}}$ collects together all terms of degree $4k{+}8$ in the Gra{\ss}mann variables $\eta^A$. In this paper, we will only study the MHV ($k=0$) component of the superamplitude, which describes (for instance) all-gluon scattering in which all but two gluons have positive helicity (in a convention in which all particles are outgoing). For more background on superfields and superamplitudes, see~\cite{Drummond:2010km,Elvang:2013cua}. 

We further specialize to the planar limit of this theory~\cite{tHooft:1973alw}, where the rank $N$ of the gauge group is sent to infinity while the product $g_{\text{YM}}^2 N$ involving the gauge theory coupling $g_{\text{YM}}$ is held constant. In this limit, multi-trace color structures are suppressed by factors of $1/N^2$, so the leading contribution to the MHV amplitude becomes
\begin{align}
\mathcal{A}_n^{\text{MHV}}  \propto \sum_{\sigma \in S_n/Z_n} \text{Tr}\big( T^{a_{\sigma(1)}} \cdots T^{a_{\sigma(n)}}  \big)  \mathcal{A}_{n,\sigma}^{\text{MHV}} \,+\, \mathcal{O}(1/N^2)\, , 
\end{align}
where $T^{a_i}$ is an $SU(N)$ generator representing the color of the $i^\text{th}$ external particle, and the sum is over all non-cyclically-related permutations of the $n$ external particles. The color-stripped amplitude $\mathcal{A}_{n,\sigma}^{\text{MHV}}$ gathers together all single-trace contributions to the amplitude that are planar with respect to the ordering $\sigma$. Without loss of generality, we focus on the color-stripped amplitude associated with the identity permutation $\sigma = \text{id}$, which collects all contributions in which the external particles are ordered from $1$ to $n$. 
%(For further details about this color decomposition, see for instance~\cite{Dixon:2011xs}.)
%We will henceforth drop the superscript $\sigma$, and assume without loss of generality that our external particles are ordered from $1$ to $n$. 

%\subsection{Infrared Divergences, Dual Conformal Symmetry, and Momentum Twistors}

We study $\mathcal{A}_n^{\text{MHV}}$ at the origin of moduli space, where all fields are massless and the amplitude is infrared-divergent. These divergences are captured by the BDS ansatz $\mathcal{A}_n^{\text{BDS}}$~\cite{Bern:2005iz}, allowing us to define a finite $n$-particle remainder function $R_n$ via the equation
\begin{align}
\mathcal{A}_{n,\,\text{id}}^{\text{MHV}} = \mathcal{A}_n^{\text{BDS}} \times \exp\left( R_n \right)  \, . \label{eq:remainder_def}
\end{align}
By construction, the BDS ansatz captures the complete one-loop amplitude, so perturbative contributions to the remainder function first occur at two loops:
\begin{equation}
R_n = \sum_{L = 2}^\infty g^{2L} R_n^{(L)} \, ,
\end{equation}
where $\smash{g^2 = \frac{g^2_{\text{YM}} N}{16 \pi^2}}$. In fact, the remainder function is exactly zero for four and five particles due to dual conformal symmetry, while for six or more particles it takes the form of a finite and DCI transcendental function~\cite{Drummond:2006rz, Bern:2006ew, Drummond:2007aua, Bern:2007ct,Nguyen:2007ya, Alday:2007hr, Bern:2008ap, Drummond:2008vq}.

In combination with planarity, dual conformal invariance strongly constrains the kinematic dependence of the nonzero contributions to the remainder function. Namely, these contributions can only depend on DCI cross-ratios of planar Mandelstam invariants $s_{i,\dots,j} = (p_i + p_{i+1} + \dots p_{j})^2$, where $p_i$ is the momentum associated with the $i^{\text{th}}$ external particle. These are often expressed in terms of squared differences of dual coordinates, 
\begin{align}
x_{ij}^2 = (x_j - x_i)^2 = (p_i+ \dots + p_{j-1})^2 = s_{i,\dots,j-1},
\end{align}
where the second equality follows from the definition of the dual coordinates via the relation $p_i = x_{i+1} - x_i$, and all indices are taken modulo $n$ (so we have $x_{n+i} = x_i$). Ratios of these squared differences are DCI whenever the same indices appear in the numerator and the denominator, for example in $(x_{ij}^2 x_{kl}^2)/(x_{ik}^2 x_{jl}^2)$.  

Four-dimensional dual points $x_i$ naturally live in a six-dimensional embedding space, and there correspondingly exists a Gram determinant relation between any seven of them. A convenient way to satisfy all of these relations is to work in terms of momentum twistors~\cite{Hodges:2009hk}, which provide a minimal parametrization of $n$-particle kinematic space. Pragmatically, momentum twistors can be thought of as the columns of a generic $4\! \times \! n$ matrix, modulo the left-action of the projective linear group (encoding dual conformal invariance) and the rescaling of any column by a nonzero complex number (encoding the little group). DCI cross-ratios are related to the entries of this matrix via the map
\begin{align}
x_{ij}^2 = \frac{\text{det}(Z_{i-1} Z_i Z_{j-1} Z_j)}{\text{det}(Z_{i-1} Z_i I_\infty) \text{det}(Z_{j-1} Z_j I_\infty)}  \, ,
\end{align} 
where $Z_i$ is the $i^\text{th}$ column of the momentum twistor matrix, and $I_\infty$ is the line in momentum-twistor space corresponding to a point at infinity in dual coordinates. While the determinants involving $I_\infty$ break dual conformal invariance, they drop out of DCI cross-ratios. 

More complicated DCI ratios can be formed out of (polynomials of) generic minors of $Z$, which are usually denoted by the four-brackets
\begin{equation} \label{eq:four_bracket_def}
\langle i j k l \rangle = \text{det}(Z_i Z_j Z_k Z_l) \, .
\end{equation}
For instance, the remainder function involves factors usually abbreviated as 
\begin{align}
\langle i (j k)( l m) (n o)\rangle &= 
\langle i j l m \rangle \langle i k n o \rangle - \langle i j n o\rangle \langle i k l m \rangle \, , \label{eq:abbrev_1} \\
\langle i j (k l m) \cap (n o p) \rangle &= 
 \langle i k l m \rangle \langle j n o p \rangle - \langle j k l m \rangle \langle i n o p \rangle \, . \label{eq:abbrev_2}
\end{align} 
Redundancies between (polynomials and ratios of) these minors are captured by Pl\"ucker relations, such as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:plucker-rel}
  \ket{abcd} \ket{efcd} = \ket{aecd} \ket{bfcd} - \ket{afcd}\ket{becd} \, .
\end{equation}
All Pl\"ucker relations are satisfied when four-brackets are evaluated on an explicit momentum twistor parametrization. Helpfully, these parameterizations also rationalize large classes of algebraic roots that appear in standard cross-ratio parametrizations~\cite{Bourjaily:2018aeq}. 

%(as we will do in section~\ref{sec:collinear_limits})
%For more details on the relation between external momenta, dual points, and momentum twistors, see for example~\cite{ArkaniHamed:2012nw,Golden:2013xva}; see also~\cite{Bourjaily:2012gy} for a Mathematica implementation of some useful tools related to momentum twistor matrices.

Finally, let us mention that the momentum twistor matrix $Z$ can be more formally thought of as an element of the quotient of the Grassmannian $\Gr(4,n)$ by rescalings of its columns~\cite{ArkaniHamed:2012nw},
\begin{equation}
Z \in \Gr(4,n)/GL(1)^{n-1} \, .
\end{equation}
This connection between planar kinematics and $\Gr(4,n)$ will prove important in what follows, as Grassmannians are naturally endowed with a cluster structure~\cite{Golden:2013xva}. In particular, the $\Gr(4,n)$ cluster algebra gives rise to a preferred set of  coordinates (and collections of coordinates) that seem to encode crucial features of the analytic structure of the two-loop remainder function. However, before exploring this connection further, we turn to a description of the types of transcendental functions that appear in these amplitudes.

\section{Motivic Aspects of Multiple Polylogarithms}
\label{sec:motivic_aspects_polylogs}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

While the remainder function is expected to depend on increasingly complicated types of functions at large multiplicities and high loop orders~\cite{Paulos:2012nu,CaronHuot:2012ab,Nandan:2013ip,Chicherin:2017bxc,Bourjaily:2017bsb,Bourjaily:2018ycu,Bourjaily:2018yfy,Bourjaily:2019hmc}, it can be expressed in terms of multiple polylogarithms at two loops~\cite{CaronHuot:2011ky}. This is propitious, as our understanding of polylogarithmic functions has advanced greatly over the last two decades. In particular, the symbol and the coaction~\cite{Goncharov:2001iea,Brown:2009qja,Goncharov:2010jf,Brown1102.1312,Brown:2015fyf} allow the analytic structure of polylogarithms to be systematically analyzed, and can moreover be used to expose all functional identities between them~\cite{Goncharov:2005sla,2011arXiv1101.4497D,Brown:2011ik,Duhr:2011zq,Duhr:2012fh}.\footnote{Note that the coaction can only be used to find all identities between polylogarithms if the algebraic identities between their symbol letters are also under control; this can prove nontrivial in practice, as seen for instance in~\cite{Bourjaily:2019igt}.} This control has proven to be increasingly useful as physical constraints on the analytic structure of amplitudes (and related quantities) have become better understood (see for instance~\cite{Bloch:2010gk,Abreu:2014cla,Bloch:2015efx,Abreu:2017ptx,Caron-Huot:2019bsq,Bourjaily:2019exo,Bourjaily:2020wvq,Benincasa:2020aoj}). In the case of the two-loop remainder function, it has also led to the discovery of the various types of cluster-algebraic structure, which we will review in section~\ref{sec:cluster_algebraic_structure} and which will comprise an essential part of our analysis in section~\ref{sec:r28_and_r29}. %to determine $R_8^{(2)}$ and $R_9^{(2)}$. 

%as the analytic structure of multiple polylogarithms can be systematically understood by studying their motivic avatars, which are under good theoretical control. In particular, the discontinuity structure of these functions can be systematically analyzed using the symbol~\cite{Goncharov:2010jf} (and more generally the motivic coaction~\cite{Gonch2,Brown:2011ik,Duhr:2011zq,Duhr:2012fh}), which decomposes polylogarithms into a tensor product of simpler functions without losing information about their analytic structure (up to terms involving transcendental constants). Moreover, this technology can be used to expose all functional relations between motivic polylogarithms, as long as all algebraic identities between the arguments of the logarithms appearing in the symbol are understood~\cite{2011arXiv1101.4497D}.\footnote{Note, however, that understanding these algebraic identities .}\footnote{Since identities that hold between motivic polylogarithms also hold between the original non-motivic functions, we won't go out of our way to distinguish these two types of objects.} In this section we review 

%---which are complex transcendental functions defined on branched Riemann surfaces---

%As such, the next section reviews multiple polylogarithms and the some of the properties of these functions that will prove useful in our analysis in section~\ref{sec:r28_and_r29}.

%For instance, the six- and seven-particle remainder functions---which have been bootstrapped through seven loops~\cite{DelDuca:2009au,DelDuca:2010zg,Dixon:2013eka,Dixon:2014voa,Caron-Huot:2016owq,Dixon:2016apl,Caron-Huot:2019vjl,Caron-Huot:2020bkp} and four loops~\cite{Drummond:2014ffa,Dixon:2016nkn,Drummond:2018caf}, respectively---are expected to be polylogarithmic to all loop orders. 

Multiple polylogarithms generalize classical polylogarithms to iterated integrals over more general logarithmic kernels. They often appear in the notation
\begin{equation} \label{eq:G_notation}
G_{a_1,\dots, a_w}(z) = \int_0^z \frac{dt}{t-a_1} G_{a_2,\dots, a_w}(z)\, ,
\end{equation}
where $G(z) = 1$ and the variables $a_i$ and $z$ are complex variables. (In the case of the remainder function, the $z$ and $a_i$ variables will be algebraic functions of DCI cross-ratios.) When all of the $a_i$ are zero, this integral diverges and is instead defined to be
\begin{equation}
\quad G_{\fwboxL{27pt}{{\underbrace{0,\dots,0}_{w}}}}(z) = \frac{\log^w z}{w!} \, .
\end{equation}
These functions form a shuffle algebra, by means of which products of polylogarithms with the same argument can be rewritten as linear combinations of polylogarithms involving more indices~\cite{Ree:1958}. Importantly, the shuffle algebra conserves the total number of indices appearing in each term. This conserved quantity, which encodes the number of integrations appearing in the definition of each polylogarithm, is referred to as that function's transcendental weight. 

Multiple polylogarithms can also be defined in terms of nested sums. This gives rise to the alternate notation
\begin{align} \label{eq:Li_notation}
\text{Li}_{n_1,\dots,n_d}(z_1,\dots, z_d) &\equiv \sum_{0 < m_1 < \dots < m_d} \frac{z_1^{m_1} \cdots z_d^{m_d}}{m_1^{n_1} \cdots m_d^{n_d}} \, ,
\end{align}
which reproduces the definition of the classical polylogarithm when the depth $d$ is one. In this notation, it becomes clear that multiple polylogarithms also obey a stuffle algebra, corresponding to the freedom to split up unordered sums into nested ones. Like the shuffle algebra, the stuffle algebra respects transcendental weight. We can relate the sum definition to the integral one using
\begin{align}
\text{Li}_{n_1,\dots,n_d}(z_1,\dots, z_d) = (-1)^d G_{\fwboxL{28pt}{\underbrace{0,\dots,0}_{n_d-1}},\frac{1}{z_d},\fwboxL{13pt}{\,\dots},\fwboxL{29pt}{\,\underbrace{0,\dots,0}_{n_1-1}},\frac{1}{z_1 \cdots z_d}}(1) \, .
\end{align}
We will make use of both of these notations, as they prove useful for different purposes. 

In what follows, we only review the motivic aspects of polylogarithms that we will make use of in our eight- and nine-point computation. In particular, we forego a complete characterization of the coaction, and focus on just the symbol (which corresponds to the maximally iterated coaction) and the Lie cobracket. We refer the interested reader to~\cite{Duhr:2014woa} for a more complete review of these topics.




%In this section we review this symbol and coaction technology, which we will make use of when we reconstruct the eight- and nine-particle amplitudes. In particular, after recalling the general formulation of these structures, we discuss how projection operators can be constructed to isolate the components of generic weight-four polylogarithms that take a different functional form. These projection operators will help us to build up the functional forms of $R_8$ and $R_9$ systematically by breaking the problem into easily manageable pieces.

%\begin{equation}
%G_{a_1,\dots, a_n}(z) = \int_0^z \frac{dt}{t-a_1} G_{a_2,\dots, a_n}(z)\,, \quad G_{\fwboxL{27pt}{{\underbrace{0,\dots,0}_{p}}}}(z) = \frac{\log^p z}{p!}  \, ,

The symbol map decomposes a generic polylogarithm into a tensor product of logarithms~\cite{Goncharov:2010jf}. It can be iteratively defined in terms of a polylogarithm's total derivatives. For instance, the total differential of the function $G_{a_1, \fwboxL{13pt}{\,\dots}, a_w}(z)$ is given by
\begin{equation} \label{eq:total_differential_G}
d G_{a_1, \fwboxL{13pt}{\,\dots}, a_w}(z) = \sum_{i=1}^{k} G_{a_1,\fwboxL{13pt}{\,\dots},\,\hat{a}_i,\fwboxL{13pt}{\,\dots},\,a_w}(z) \ d\log \left( \frac{a_{w-i+1} - a_{w-i}}{a_{w-i+1} - a_{w-i+2}} \right)\, ,
\end{equation} 
where $a_0 \equiv z$ and $a_{w+1} \equiv 0$, and the notation $\hat{a}_i$ indicates this index should be omitted~\cite{GoncharovMixedTate,Duhr:2011zq}. The symbol of this function is then defined by promoting the $d\log$s in~\eqref{eq:total_differential_G} to new tensor factors, via the recursive definition  
\begin{equation} \label{eq:symbol_def}
\mathcal{S}\big(G_{a_1, \fwboxL{13pt}{\,\dots}, a_w}(z)\big) \equiv \sum_{i=1}^{w} \mathcal{S}\big(G_{a_1,\fwboxL{13pt}{\,\dots},\,\hat{a}_i,\fwboxL{13pt}{\,\dots},\,a_w}(z) \big) \otimes \left( \frac{a_{w-i+1} - a_{w-i}}{a_{w-i+1} - a_{w-i+2}} \right)\, .
\end{equation} 
This recursion terminates once all indices have been dropped, with $\mathcal{S}(G(z)) = 1$.

The algebraic functions that appear in different entries of the symbol are referred to as symbol letters. These letters inherit the distributive properties of (arguments of) logarithms, and can therefore be expanded into a multiplicatively independent basis of symbol letters, referred to as a symbol alphabet. The symbol map thus reduces (potentially complicated) polylogarithmic identities to identities between logarithms, at the cost of losing information about higher-weight transcendental constants and the integration contour of the original polylogarithm. In particular, all terms involving factors of $i\pi$ must be dropped from the symbol, as these terms correspond to deformations of the original integration contour around logarithmic branch points.
 
The symbol captures key information about the analytic structure of polylogarithms, insofar as it encodes their iterated discontinuity structure. Namely, for generic $a_i$ and $z$, these functions have logarithmic branch points only where the letters in the first entry of their symbol become zero or infinite. However, the discontinuity of a polylogarithm can have new logarithmic branch points when new symbol letters appear in the second entry of its symbol (and similarly for further iterated discontinuities). In this sense, the symbol keeps track of all of a polylogarithm's nonzero sequences of discontinuities.

\subsection{The Lie Cobracket and Projection Operators}
\label{sec:lie_cobracket}

While the symbol encodes a great deal of information about a function, it does not tell us everything we might want to know; for instance, it does not allow us to compute the numerical value of this function at a given value of its arguments. Thus, we are often in the position of wanting to upgrade the symbol of a function to a complete polylogarithmic expression. While this can prove hard in general, certain information about the polylogarithmic form of a symbol can be discerned with the use of the Lie cobracket~\cite{Golden:2013xva}. 

The cobracket of a symbol $S$ of weight $w$ can be computed as
\begin{equation} \label{eq:cobracket_def}
\delta(S) \equiv \sum_{i=1}^{w-1} (\rho_i \wedge \rho_{w-i})\rho(S) \, ,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\rho(s_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes s_w ) = \frac{w-1}{w} \Big(\rho(s_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes s_{w-1}) \otimes s_w - \rho(s_2 \otimes \cdots \otimes s_{w}) \otimes s_1 \Big) \, 
\end{equation}
and $\rho(s_1) \equiv s_1$. The notation in~\eqref{eq:cobracket_def} should be understood to mean that $\rho$ is first applied to $S$, after which each term in the resulting sum is partitioned into a wedge product by splitting up the symbol into its first $i$ and last $w{-}i$ entries; the operator $\rho$ is then applied to the two factors of this wedge product separately. The cobracket thus gives rise to a sum of wedge products involving different transcendental weights. We use the notation $\delta_{i,j}(S)$ to denote all contributions to the cobracket coming from terms that involve a wedge product between factors of weight $i$ and $j$. 

Through weight four, any polylogarithm can be expressed in terms of (products of) classical polylogarithms $\Li_k(z)$ with $k \leq 4$, and nonclassical polylogarithms of the form $\Li_{k,4-k}(x,y)$. The cobracket $\delta$ is useful because it separates out the contribution to a symbol coming from these different types of functions. For instance, the operator $\rho$ that appears in~\eqref{eq:cobracket_def} projects out the part of a symbol that can be written as products of lower-weight classical polylogarithms. In particular, when it acts on the classical polylogarithm $\Li_k(z)$, it maps it to an element of the Bloch group $\text{B}_k$~\cite{Bloch:2000, Suslin:1990}, or the algebra of polylogarithms modulo identities between classical polylogarithms. We denote these elements by
\begin{align}
 \{ z \}_k  &\equiv \rho(-\text{Li}_k(-z)) \in \text{B}_k, \quad k>1, \\
 \{ z \}_1  &\equiv \rho(\log(z)) \hspace{.675cm} \in \text{B}_1.
\end{align}
At weight four, the cobracket further separates out contributions coming from different types of polylogarithms. More specifically, the $\delta_{2,2}$ component is only sensitive to contributions from nonclassical polylogarithms $\Li_{k,4-k}(x,y)$, while the $\delta_{3,1}$ component encodes contributions from both nonclassical polylogarithms as well as weight-four classical polylogarithms $\Li_4(z)$~\cite{G91a,2008arXiv0809.3984D,GanglPolylogIdentities,2018arXiv180107816G,2018arXiv180308585G}. 

As we will discuss in more detail in section~\ref{sec:subalgebra_constructibility}, these facts allow the nonclassical part of the remainder function to be matched to an appropriate ansatz of nonclassical polylogarithms at the level of the $\delta_{2,2}$ cobracket. Assuming this can be done, the $\delta_{3,1}$ component can then be used to isolate additional contributions coming from the weight-four classical polylogarithms. Note that this classical contribution is not by itself well-defined, since there exist many nonclassical weight-four polylogarithms with the same $\delta_{2,2}$ component but different $\delta_{3,1}$ components. However, any weight-four function whose complete cobracket matches that of the original symbol provides a valid functional representation of the symbol, up to products of lower-weight functions.  

Further projection operators can be defined to isolate and determine the lower-weight products of classical polylogarithms, as described in~\cite{Goncharov:2010jf}. For instance, consider the contribution involving products of weight-two classical polylogarithms, $\Li_2(x) \Li_2(y)$. To determine this component, we define an operator
\begin{equation}
\delta_{\Li_2 \Li_2} (S)= (\rho_2 \wedge \rho_2)\, S \, , \label{eq:proj_op_1}
\end{equation}
which means we apply $\rho$ to the first two entries and last two entries of the symbol separately. It is not hard to check that this operator will project out all products of classical polylogarithms except for $\Li_2(x) \Li_2(y)$. It will not project out contributions from $\Li_{k,4-k}(x,y)$ or $\Li_4(z)$, but we assume some functional representation of this weight-four contribution is known and can be subtracted off before computing $\delta_{\Li_2 \Li_2}$. In a similar manner, products of the form $\Li_3(x) \log y$ can be isolated using the operator
\begin{equation}
\delta_{\Li_3 \log} (S)= (\rho_3 \wedge \text{id})\, S \,  \label{eq:proj_op_2} 
\end{equation}
(again, up to contributions from $\Li_{k,4-k}(x,y)$ or $\Li_4(z)$).  Having isolated these contributions, we can try to match them to appropriate ans{\"a}tze at function level.

We would also like to isolate contributions to the symbol coming from functions of the form $\Li_2(x) \log y  \log z$. To do so, we define the operator
\begin{equation}
\delta_{\Li_2 \log \log} (S)= (\rho_2 \wedge \text{id})\, S \, . \label{eq:proj_op_3}
\end{equation}
This operator is less precise than the other projection operators; in addition to contributions from $\Li_{k,4-k}(x,y)$ and $\Li_4(z)$, it lets through contributions from $\Li_2(x) \Li_2(y)$ and $\Li_3(x) \log y$. However, we again assume that functional representations of these contributions have been determined and can be subtracted off along with the weight-four contributions. 

Assuming each of the preceding components of the symbol have been matched by appropriate functions, the problem now reduces to matching products of logarithms. This final component is the easiest to upgrade to function level, since it merely requires unshuffling the logarithms whose arguments appear directly in the symbol.  
 
The projection operators~\eqref{eq:proj_op_1}-\eqref{eq:proj_op_3}, in combination with the different components of the cobracket, allow us to split up the problem of upgrading a symbol to a function into smaller intermediate steps. This can prove necessary when considering large symbols. In extreme cases, the problem of matching a symbol to a function can be split up even further by focusing on terms that involve specific Bloch group elements. We will make use of this strategy in section~\ref{sec:r28_and_r29}, and describe it in more detail there.

\section{Cluster-Algebraic Aspects of \pdfeq{R_n^{(2)}}}
\label{sec:cluster_algebraic_structure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The analytic structure of the two-loop remainder function has been observed to exhibit many surprising features that seem most elegantly expressed in the language of $\Gr(4,n)$ cluster algebras~\cite{1021.16017}.  In this section, we give a brief overview of some of this structure, with an emphasis on those aspects that will allow us to construct $R_8^{(2)}$\! and $R_9^{(2)}$\! in the next section. We refer the reader to~\cite{Golden:2018gtk} for a more comprehensive review of cluster algebras and their connection to amplitudes in planar $\mathcal{N} = 4$ sYM theory. 

Let us begin by recalling the definition of the $\Gr(4,n)$ cluster algebra. The initial seed cluster for $\Gr(4,n)$ can be chosen to be~\cite{1088.22009}

\end{gathered} 
\end{equation}
where $l=n-4$ and 
\begin{equation}
  f_{i j} =
  \begin{cases}
    \langle i+1, \dotsc, 4, j + 4, \dotsc, i+j+3\rangle, \qquad &i \leq l-j+1,\\
    \langle 1, \dotsc, i+j-l-1, i+1, \dotsc, 4, j+4, \dotsc, n\rangle, \qquad &i >l-j+1.
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
The four-brackets associated with the nodes of the graph~\eqref{eq:g4n-seed} identify an initial set of cluster $\a$-coordinates, while the arrows define an exchange matrix 
\begin{equation}
b_{i j} = (\# \text{ of arrows}\; i \to j) - (\# \text{ of arrows}\; j \to i) \, .
\label{eq:bijdef}
\end{equation}
The nodes associated with boxed $\a$-coordinates are considered frozen, while all other nodes can be mutated on to generate new clusters. Mutating on node $k$ alters the arrows in a cluster via the following sequence of operations:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[(1)] for each sequence of arrows $i\to k \to j$, add a new arrow $i\to j$,
	\item[(2)] reverse all arrows on edges incident with $k$,
	\item[(3)] remove any two-cycles that have appeared.
\end{itemize}
Algebraically, this generates a new adjacency matrix 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:b-mutation}
  b'_{i j} =
  \begin{cases}
    -b_{i j}, &\quad \text{if $k \in \lbrace i, j\rbrace$,}\\
    b_{i j}, &\quad \text{if $b_{i k} b_{k j} \leq 0$,}\\
    b_{i j} + b_{i k} b_{k j}, &\quad \text{if $b_{i k}, b_{k j} > 0$,}\\
    b_{i j} - b_{i k} b_{k j}, &\quad \text{if $b_{i k}, b_{k j} < 0$.}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
Mutation also generates new $\a$-coordinates. Denoting the $\a$-coordinate associated with node $i$ by $a_i$, mutation on node $k$ trades the original coordinate $a_k$ for $a_k'$, defined via the relation
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:a-coord-mutation}
  a_{k} a_{k}' = \prod_{i \vert b_{i k} > 0} a_{i}^{b_{i k}} + \prod_{i \vert b_{i k} < 0} a_{i}^{-b_{i k}},
\end{equation} 
where empty products are set to 1. All other cluster $\a$-coordinates remain unchanged. 

Mutation is an involution, so mutating twice on node $k$ has no net effect. However, mutating on different sequences  of nodes gives rise to new clusters and $\a$-coordinates. The $\Gr(4,n)$ cluster algebra is defined to be the set of all clusters and cluster coordinates that can be generated from~\eqref{eq:g4n-seed} via some sequence of mutations. For $n \le 7$, only a finite number of clusters can be generated, while an infinite number can be generated for $n\ge8$. 

In addition to cluster $\a$-coordinates, cluster algebras give rise to a natural set of cluster $\x$-coordinates. The $\x$-coordinate associated with each mutable node $i$ is given by the ratio of $\a$-coordinates
\begin{equation} \label{eq:x_from_a_coordinates}
	x_i = \prod_j a_j^{b_{ji}}. 	
\end{equation} 
Mutation rules for \xcoords are different than for $\a$-coordinates; when mutating on node $k$, these coordinates change as 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:x-coord-mutation}
  x_{i}' =
  \begin{cases}
    x_{k}^{-1}, &\quad i=k,\\
    x_{i} (1+x_{k}^{\sgn b_{i k}})^{b_{i k}}, &\quad i \neq k ,
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
while the arrows change just as they did for $\a$-coordinates. Note that the translation between $\a$-coordinates and $\x$-coordinates in~\eqref{eq:x_from_a_coordinates} commutes with mutation. 

Because of the inclusion of the frozen nodes in~\eqref{eq:g4n-seed}, the ratios of matrix minors defined by~\eqref{eq:x_from_a_coordinates} are invariant under the rescaling of any column of the underlying matrix. These $\x$-coordinates consequently respect dual conformal symmetry when evaluated on momentum twistor matrices. Since, moreover, the set of $3n{-}15$ $\x$-coordinates found in any cluster of $\Gr(4,n)$ are algebraically independent, cluster algebras give rise to many convenient parameterizations of $n$-particle DCI kinematic space. As we now review, these coordinates also naturally lend themselves to the description of the analytic properties of the two-loop remainder function, making them especially advantageous coordinates in terms of which to formulate these amplitudes. 

%We emphasize that most of these cluster-algebraic properties do not extend to all polylogarithmic amplitudes in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ sYM theory, since (for instance) algebraic branch points are known to occur~\cite{Prlina:2017azl,Zhang:2019vnm}. However, this structure provides us with a useful computational handle by which to understand the two-loop MHV amplitude to all orders. Thus, in the next two sections we review of the aspects of polylogarithms that allow us to isolate this cluster-algebraic structure, and the properties of (infinite) cluster algebras that will be salient to our study of the two-loop remainder function for eight and nine particles.  


\subsection{The Subalgebra Constructibility of \pdfeq{\delta_{2,2}\big(R_n^{(2)} \big)}}

Surprising connections between the analytic structure of $R_n^{(2)}$\! and cluster coordinates on $\Gr(4,n)$ already appear at the level of the cobracket. For instance, in~\cite{Golden:2014pua} it was shown that the cobracket of $R_n^{(2)}$\! can be put in the form
\begin{equation} \label{eq:cobracket_decomp}
\delta\big(R^{(2)}_n\big) = \sum_{i,j} \Big(c_{ij} \, \{x_i\}_2 \wedge \{x_j\}_2 + d_{ij} \, \{x_i\}_3 \wedge \{x_j\}_1 \Big) \, ,
\end{equation}
where $c_{ij}$ and $d_{ij}$ are some rational coefficients, and the arguments $x_i$ and $x_j$ that appear in elements of the Bloch group are cluster $\x$-coordinates. Moreover, it was shown there that the sum over $i$ and $j$ can be restricted to span over only coordinates $x_i$ and $x_j$ that appear together in some cluster of $\Gr(4,n)$.\footnote{Note that this `cobracket-level cluster adjacency' neither implies nor is implied by the similar property of cluster adjacency observed at the level of the symbol in~\cite{Drummond:2017ssj}.} While striking, the physical interpretation of this decomposition remains unclear.

It has also been observed that the $\delta_{2,2}$ component of the cobracket can be decomposed in an entirely different way, into a single function evaluated on different subalgebras of $\Gr(4,n)$~\cite{Golden:2014xqa}. For instance, there always exists a decomposition of the form
\begin{equation} \label{eq:a2_decomp}
	\delta_{2,2} \big(R_n^{(2)}\big) = \!\! \sum_{(x_i\to x_j) \subset \Gr(4,n)} \!\!\! e_{ij} ~\delta_{2,2}\big(f^{--}_{A_2}(x_i \to x_j) \big) \, ,
\end{equation}
for some set of rational coefficients $e_{ij}$, where the sum is over a finite number of the $A_2$ subalgebras of $\Gr(4,n)$, each labelled by one of their constituent clusters $x_i \to x_j$. The function $f^{--}_{A_2}$ evaluated on these $A_2$ subalgebras is a weight-four polylogarithm, which (following~\cite{Golden:2018gtk}) we define to be
\begin{align}\label{def:a2-function}
        f^{--}_{A_2}(x_1 \to x_2)  &= \sum_{\text{skew-dihedral}} \bigg[ \Li_{2,2}\left(-\frac{1}{\x_{i-1}},-\frac{1}{\x_{i+1}}\right) - \Li_{1,3}\left(-\frac{1}{\x_{i-1}},-\frac{1}{\x_{i+1}}\right)  \\
        &\hspace{1.1cm} -6 \Li_3\left(-\x_{i-1}\right) \log \left(\x_{i+1}\right) -\frac{1}{2} \log \left(\x_{i-2}\right) \log^2\! \left(\x_i\right) \log \left(\x_{i+1}\right)  {\color{white} \bigg|} \nonumber \\
        &\hspace{1.1cm} +\Li_2(-\x_{i-1}) \Big(3 \log (\x_{i-1})\log (\x_{i+1})+\log \big(\x_{i-2}/\x_{i+2}\big)\log (\x_{i+2})\Big) \bigg], \nonumber
\end{align}
where 
\begin{gather}\label{def:a2-xcoords}
  \x_1 = 1/x_1, \qquad \qquad \x_2 = x_2, \qquad \qquad \x_3 = x_1(1+x_2), \\ 
  \x_4 = \frac{1+x_1+x_1 x_2}{x_2}, \qquad \qquad \x_5 = \frac{1+x_1}{x_1 x_2}, \nonumber
\end{gather}
are five of the cluster $\x$-coordinates generated by the $A_2$ seed cluster $x_1 \to x_2$. The skew-dihedral sum is taken by summing $i$ from 1 to 5, and subtracting off the same quantity in which $\x_i \to \x_{6-i}$.

The function $f^{--}_{A_2}$ has a number of notable features. Both the arguments of the Bloch group elements that appear in its Lie cobracket and the letters that appear in its symbol alphabet consist solely of cluster $\x$-coordinate arguments drawn from $\Gr(4,n)$. 
%Lie cobracket can be expressed in terms of Bloch group elements with cluster $\x$-coordinate arguments, while its symbol alphabet consists of $\x$-coordinates. Moreover, this symbol respects cluster adjacency, meaning that it can be put in a form where $\x$-coordinates only appear in adjacent entries if they also appear together in a cluster. 
It is also a smooth and real-valued function for positive values of the cluster coordinates $x_1, x_2>0$, and it respects the automorphism group of the $A_2$ cluster algebra. This group has two generators,
\begin{align} 
  \sigma_{A_2}:&\quad x_1\to \frac{1}{x_2},~~ x_2\to x_1(1+x_2), \label{eq:a2_automorphism_generator_1} \\
  \tau_{A_2}:&\quad  x_1 \to \frac{x_1 x_2}{1 + x_1}, ~~x_2 \to \frac{1 + x_1 + x_1 x_2}{x_2}, \label{eq:a2_automorphism_generator_2}
\end{align}
both of which map $f_{A_2}^{--}$ back to minus itself (this is the reason for the superscript in the function's name). 

While the decomposition in~\eqref{eq:a2_decomp} is special, it is not unique, nor is this type of decomposition unique to $A_2$ subalgebras. However, only a handful of nonclassical polylogarithms can appear in decompositions of this type, due to the requirement that they respect the automorphism group of the cluster algebra on which they are defined. Despite this, a surprising number of nonclassical decompositions of the two-loop remainder function seem to exist. For instance, the web of nested decompositions depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:R27_decompositions} were found for $\smash{\delta_{2,2}\big( R_7^{(2)}\big)}$ in~\cite{Golden:2018gtk}. In this diagram, each function $f_\mathcal{A}^{s_1 \dots s_n}$ represents a weight-four polylogarithm defined on the cluster algebra $\a$, which has signature $s_i$ under the action of the $i^\text{th}$ generator of the automorphism group of $\a$. (We will give the explicit form of these generators for the $A_n$ cluster algebras in section~\ref{sec:subalgebra_constructibility}; for the $D_5$ case we refer the reader to~\cite{Golden:2018gtk}.) An arrow $\smash{f_\mathcal{A}^{s_1 \dots s_n} \to f_\mathcal{A^\prime}^{s_1^\prime \dots s_m^\prime}}$ indicates that the $\delta_{2,2} \big(\smash{f_\mathcal{A}^{s_1 \dots s_n}}\big)$ can be decomposed into instances of $\smash{f_\mathcal{A^\prime}^{s_1^\prime \dots s_m^\prime}}$ evaluated on the subalgebras $\a^\prime \subset \a$. Note that some sequence of arrows leads from every one of the functions in this diagram to $f_{A_2}^{--}$, implying that they can be all be decomposed in terms of the function defined in~\eqref{def:a2-function}. We refer to the original paper for the definition of the other functions appearing in this diagram. 

%In section~\ref{sec:subalgebra_constructibility} we will look for further examples of this type of subalgebra constructibility, focusing on the eight- and nine-particle amplitudes. While finding such decompositions in these cases is trickier than at seven points since the cluster algebras associated with these higher-point amplitudes are infinite, we will see there that decompositions involving many of the functions in Figure~\ref{fig:R27_decompositions} can still be found.

\subsection{Symbol Alphabets and Cluster Adjacency}

More cluster-algebraic structure can be found in the symbol of the remainder function. In particular, the symbol alphabet of $R_n^{(2)}$\! has been shown to consist of just $\frac{3}{2} n (n - 5)^2$ cluster $\mathcal{A}$-coordinates drawn from $\Gr(4,n)$, implying that the remainder function only develops branch cuts where these cluster coordinates vanish or become infinite~\cite{Golden:2013xva}. It is worth highlighting that, while this observation has also been found to extend to higher loops in the case of $R_6$ and $R_7$~\cite{Caron-Huot:2020bkp,Prlina:2018ukf}, algebraic symbol letters are expected to appear in the remainder function at higher multiplicities. These letters cannot be cluster coordinates, since all cluster coordinates are rational. Even so, it is interesting to note that some of the algebraic letters that appear in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ sYM theory have been seen to emerge from structures related to Grassmannian cluster algebras~\cite{Drummond:2019cxm,Arkani-Hamed:2019rds,Henke:2019hve,Drummond:2020kqg,Mago:2020kmp,He:2020uhb,Herderschee:2021dez}. 

Further structure can be uncovered by normalizing the amplitude in terms of the BDS-like ansatz~\cite{Alday:2009dv,Yang:2010as}. In this subtraction scheme, it has been observed that symbol letters only appear in adjacent entries when they also appear together in a cluster of $\Gr(4,n)$~\cite{Drummond:2017ssj}. This property, referred to as cluster adjacency, seems to encode the extended Steinmann relations~\cite{Caron-Huot:2018dsv,Caron-Huot:2019bsq}, which generalize the Steinmann relations to all sequential discontinuities~\cite{Steinmann,Steinmann2,Cahill:1973qp}. However, while cluster adjacency is known to imply the extended Steinmann relations~\cite{Golden:2019kks}, the converse has not yet been shown.


Although the decomposition of the amplitude given in equation~\eqref{eq:remainder_def} obscures cluster adjacency, we continue to work with the remainder function for two reason. First, the BDS-like ansatz does not exist in eight-particle kinematics~\cite{Yang:2010as}. (Although it is possible to define a finite amplitude that respects cluster adjacency and the extended Steinmann relations for this number of particles, it requires giving up dual conformal invariance~\cite{Golden:2018gtk}.) Second, the remainder function is engineered to have smooth collinear limits, which we will see in section~\ref{sec:r28_and_r29} proves to be a more useful property in our analysis than cluster adjacency. 

\subsection{Negative Cluster Coordinate Arguments}
\label{sec:neg_cluster_coodinate_args}

Cluster coordinates also play a special role in the functional form of $R_n^{(2)}$\!. This can be seen explicitly in the cases of $\smash{R_6^{(2)}}$\! and $\smash{R_7^{(2)}}$\!, which turn out to be expressible in terms of polylogarithms (in the sum notation) with negative $\x$-coordinates arguments~\cite{Golden:2013xva,Golden:2014xqf}. The same class of functions also suffices for expressing the nonclassical contribution to $R_n^{(2)}$\! at all multiplicity by virtue of the decomposition in~\eqref{eq:a2_decomp}.\footnote{While we have expressed the weight-one functions in $f^{--}_{A_2}$ as logarithms with positive cluster coordinate arguments, it is not hard to check that these functions can be rewritten in terms of classical polylogarithms with negative cluster coordinate arguments.} It is therefore natural to extend this expectation to the classical component of these functions, and to look for functional representations of $R_n^{(2)}$\! that involve only $f_{A_2}^{--}$ and classical polylogarithms with negative $\x$-coordinates arguments~\cite{Golden:2014xqf}.

The choice of this class of functions has the added benefit that it makes certain properties of the amplitude manifest. In particular, the amplitude is expected to be real-valued in the positive region, which is defined by the inequalities $\langle i j k l \rangle > 0$ for all cyclically ordered $i$, $j$, $k$, and $l$. It is easy to see that the $\a$-coordinates in the initial seed~\eqref{eq:g4n-seed} will all be positive in this region, and that this positivity will be inherited by all further $\a$-coordinates generated by the mutation rule~\eqref{eq:a-coord-mutation}. It follows that all $\x$-coordinates are also positive in this region. As a result, the sum of $A_2$ functions appearing in decompositions of the form~\eqref{eq:a2_decomp} will be manifestly real-valued in the positive region, as $f^{--}_{A_2}(x_1 \to x_2)$ is itself manifestly smooth and real-valued for positive values of $x_1$ and $x_2$. A similar observation holds for the classical polylogarithms $\Li_k(-x)$, which are manifestly real-valued for positive values of $x$.
 
It might seem like restricting our attention to this class of functions will not help in practice, since there are an infinite number of cluster $\x$-coordinates when $n>7$. However, we can first focus on the cluster coordinates that actually appear in the symbol of $R_n^{(2)}$\!. To construct these $\x$-coordinates (since the symbol of $R_n^{(2)}$\! is known only in terms of $\a$-coordinates~\cite{CaronHuot:2011ky}), we begin by listing all DCI cross ratios that can be built out of the $\a$-coordinates that appear in the symbol. We then use the empirical test proposed in~\cite{Golden:2013xva} to determine which of these cross ratios is a genuine $\x$-coordinate. Namely, we select the cross ratios $v$ that have the property that $1+v$ factorizes into a product of $\a$-coordinates, and numerically evaluate $v$, $-1-v$, and $-1-1/v$ at a random point in the positive region. In all known examples, only one of these values will be positive, and will correspond to an $\x$-coordinate. While there is no guarantee that this list of $\x$-coordinates will provide a sufficient set of polylogarithmic arguments for expressing $R_n^{(2)}$\! at function level, we will see in section~\ref{sec:r28_and_r29} that no further $\x$-coordinates are needed in the cases of $R_8^{(2)}$\! or $R_9^{(2)}$\!.

\section{The Subalgebra Constructibility of \pdfeq{R_8^{(2)}} and \pdfeq{R_9^{(2)}}}
\label{sec:subalgebra_constructibility}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Motivated by the web of decompositions found in seven-particle kinematics~\cite{Golden:2018gtk}, we begin our study of $R_8^{(2)}$\! and $R_9^{(2)}$\! by exploring their subalgebra constructibility---that is, we investigate the ways in which $\smash{\delta_{2,2}\big(R_8^{(2)}\big)}$ and $\smash{\delta_{2,2}\big(R_9^{(2)}\big)}$ can be decomposed into polylogarithms evaluated on the subalgebras of $\Gr(4,8)$ and $\Gr(4,9)$. Decompositions of this type were first studied in~\cite{Golden:2014xqa}, where they were found to exist over the $A_2$ and $A_3$ subalgebras of $\Gr(4,n)$ in terms of the functions $f_{A_2}^{--}$ and $f_{A_3}^{--}$. Here, we investigate whether the eight- and nine-particle remainder functions are subalgebra constructible in terms of the other functions that were found to give rise to nontrivial decompositions of the seven-particle remainder function.

% (as summarized in Figure~\ref{fig:R27_decompositions}).

%Decompositions of this type were originally studied in~\cite{Golden:2014xqa}, where they were found to exist over both the $A_2$ and $A_3$ subalgebras of $\Gr(4,n)$ at all multiplicity. However, many further , motivating us to search for novel decompositions of the eight- and nine-particle remainder function. 
%$\smash{\delta_{2,2}\big( R_n^{(2)}\big)}$

Following~\cite{Golden:2014xqa,Golden:2018gtk}, we refer to the class of polylogarithms that appear in these decompositions of the two-loop remainder function as cluster polylogarithms. More precisely, we adopt the following definition:
\begin{quote}
{\bf Cluster Polylogarithm}: A polylogarithmic function constitutes a cluster polylogarithm on the cluster algebra $\a$ if
\vspace{-.2cm}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item[(i)] its symbol alphabet can be written entirely in terms of $\a$-coordinates of $\mathcal{A}$, 
 \item[(ii)] its Lie cobracket can be expressed in terms of Bloch group elements whose arguments are all $\x$-coordinates of $\mathcal{A}$,
 \item[(iii)] it is invariant under the automorphism group of $\mathcal{A}$, up to a sign.
 \end{itemize}
\end{quote}
The last condition ensures that these functions are well-defined functions on the cluster algebra $\a$, which in particular requires that they return the same value (up to a sign) when evaluated on any of the clusters in $\a$ that share the same directed graph structure.  

A complete classification of the nonclassical cluster polylogarithms that can be defined on the subalgebras of $\Gr(4,n)$ has been carried out through rank five~\cite{Golden:2018gtk} (see also~\cite{Harrington:2015bdt}). In principle, this makes searching for a decomposition of $\smash{\delta_{2,2}\big(R_n^{(2)} \big)}$ over these lower-rank subalgebras easy. One merely needs to evaluate a chosen set of cluster polylogarithms on the appropriate subalgebras of $\Gr(4,n)$, and see if any linear combination of their $\delta_{2,2}$ cobracket components matches $\smash{\delta_{2,2}\big(R_n^{(2)} \big)}$. This procedure can in principle be carried out on any combination of these cluster polylogarithms, but we here restrict our attention to decompositions that only involve a single function.

Of course, an exhaustive search for subalgebra decompositions of this type cannot be carried out when $n>7$, due to the infinite nature of the underlying cluster algebras. We circumvent this problem by restricting our attention to the subalgebras of $\Gr(4,n)$ that only involve cluster $\x$-coordinates that appear in the symbol of $R_n^{(2)}$\!. Using the method described at the end of section \ref{sec:neg_cluster_coodinate_args}, we find there are 3176 and 7812 such $\x$-coordinates at eight and nine points, respectively. To generate all subalgebras that can be constructed out of these coordinates, we use the Sklyanin bracket~\cite{Sklyanin:1982tf,GSV}, which allows us compute the number of directed edges between any two cluster $\x$-coordinates when they appear in a cluster together (or alternately tells us that they don't appear together in a cluster). For instance, to search for rank-four subalgebras, we first use the Sklyanin bracket to find all sets of four $\x$-coordinates that can appear together in a cluster of $\Gr(4,n)$; since the Sklyanin bracket also tells us how the nodes associated with these coordinates are connected, we can then mutate on these nodes to determine what type of subalgebra each set generates, and whether this subalgebra involves cluster coordinates beyond those appearing in the symbol of $R_n^{(2)}$\!. For more details on how to compute the Sklyanin bracket between pairs of cluster coordinates, see~\cite{Vergu:2015svm,Golden:2019kks}. 

%\footnote{While subalgebras involving $\x$-coordinates beyond those appearing in the symbol of $R_n^{(2)}$\! could still give rise to interesting decompositions, we have not found any such decompositions.}

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ c |  c | c | c | c | c | c | c }      
 \ & $E_6$ & $D_5$ & $A_5$ & $D_4$ & $A_4$ & $A_3$ & $A_2$  \\
\hline
$\Gr(4,8)$ & 0 & 0 & 56 & 24 & 496 & 1600 & 2240 \\ \hline
$\Gr(4,9)$ & 0  & 0 & 135 & 45 & 1197 & 3936 & 5580 
\end{tabular}
\end{center} 
\caption{The number of subalgebras of $\Gr(4,8)$ and $\Gr(4,9)$ of a given type that can be constructed out of the cluster $\x$-coordinates that appear in the symbols of $R_8^{(2)}$\! and $R_9^{(2)}$\!.}
\label{table:subalgebra_counts}
\end{table}

Using this procedure, we have generated all subalgebras of $\Gr(4,8)$ and $\Gr(4,9)$ through rank five, as well as all $E_6$ subalgebras, that can be constructed solely out of the $\x$-coordinates that appear in the symbols of $R_8^{(2)}$\! and $R_9^{(2)}$\!. We report the number of subalgebras of each type in Table~\ref{table:subalgebra_counts}. The most striking feature of this table is the nonexistence of any $E_6$ or $D_5$ subalgebras that are contructible in this way. This immediately implies that there are no natural decompositions of $\smash{\delta_{2,2}\big(R_8^{(2)}\big)}$ or $\smash{\delta_{2,2}\big(R_9^{(2)}\big)}$ in terms of the function $f_{D_5}^{---}$\!, which gave rise to a unique decomposition of the seven-particle remainder function, or in terms of $R_7^{(2)}$\! itself. However, decompositions into the other functions in terms of which $\smash{\delta_{2,2}\big(R_7^{(2)}\big)}$ was constructible remain possible.

Referring back to Figure~\ref{fig:R27_decompositions}, we see that there are five such functions of interest, associated with the $A_2$, $A_3$, $A_4$, and $A_5$ cluster algebras. As mentioned above, decompositions in terms of two of these functions ($f_{A_2}^{--}$ and $f_{A_3}^{--}$) are already known to exist~\cite{Golden:2014xqa}. However, these decompositions are not unique, whereas the nested decompositions that were found in terms of the remaining three functions ($f_{A_3}^{+-}$, $f_{A_4}^{+-}$, and $f_{A_5}^{--}$) proved to be unique for seven particles. Correspondingly, we would like to answer the question of whether the remainder function is subalgebra constructible in terms of $f_{A_3}^{+-}$, $f_{A_4}^{+-}$, or $f_{A_5}^{--}$ at higher multiplicity---and if so, whether these decompositions remain unique. 
 
 % while the use of $f_{A_3}^{--}$ makes manifest the intriguing property of cobracket-level cluster adjacency (described below~\eqref{eq:cobracket_decomp}),

\paragraph{The Eight-Particle Remainder Function}~\\[-10pt]

\noindent We first explore this question in eight-particle kinematics. To do so, we construct an ansatz out of each of the functions $f_{A_3}^{+-}$, $f_{A_4}^{+-}$, and $f_{A_5}^{--}$ by evaluating them on the subalgebras of $\Gr(4,8)$ that were found using the methods described above. We then attempt to find $\smash{\delta_{2,2}\big( R_8^{(2)}\big)}$ in the span of the $\delta_{2,2}$ cobracket component of these functions. For instance, to look for a decomposition in terms of the function $f_{A_3}^{-+}$, we see if there exists a rational set of coefficients $c_{ijk}$ such that
\begin{equation}
\delta_{2,2}\big( R_8^{(2)} \big) = \!\! \sum_{(x_i \to x_j \to x_k) \subset \Gr(4,8)} \!\!\! c_{ijk} ~\delta_{2,2}\big( f_{A_3}^{--} (x_i \to x_j \to x_k)\big) \, ,
\end{equation}
where the sum is over all of the $A_3$ subalgebras of  $\Gr(4,8)$ cataloged in Table~\ref{table:subalgebra_counts}, each labelled by one of their constituent clusters $x_i \to x_j \to x_k$. Proceeding in this way, we find novel decompositions of the eight-particle remainder function in terms of both $\smash{f_{A_3}^{+-}}$ and $\smash{f_{A_5}^{--}}$, but no decomposition in terms of $\smash{f_{A_4}^{+-}}$.

To describe these new $A_3$ and $A_5$ decompositions, let us first recall some facts about the automorphism group of the $A_n$ cluster algebra. This group is given by the dihedral group of order $2(3{+}n)$, whose generators can be chosen to be
\begin{equation} \label{eq:def_An_cycle}
  \sigma_{A_n}:\quad x_{k<n} \to \frac{x_{k+1}(1+x_{1,\ldots,k-1})}{1+x_{1,\ldots,k+1}},~~x_n\to\frac{1+x_{1,\ldots,n-1}}{\prod_{i=1}^n x_i} \, 
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation} \label{eq:def_An_flip}
  \tau_{A_n}: \quad x_1 \to \frac{1}{x_n},~~x_2 \to \frac{1}{x_{n-1}},~\ldots~, \quad x_n\to\frac{1}{x_1} \, ,
\end{equation}
which have lengths $n+3$ and $2$, respectively.\footnote{We note that these generators differ from those given in~\eqref{eq:a2_automorphism_generator_1} and~\eqref{eq:a2_automorphism_generator_2} when $n$ is $2$; however, either set of generators can be used.} The action of these generators is consistent with the notation we have been using for the $A_n$ cluster polylogarithms encountered thus far; that is, the action of $\sigma_{A_n}$ maps the function $f_{A_n}^{s_1 s_2}$ back to itself with an overall sign $s_1$, while the action of $\tau_{A_n}$ maps this function back to itself with an overall sign $s_2$. We refer the reader to~\cite{Golden:2018gtk} for more details on this topic.

The function $f_{A_3}^{+-}$ can be easily defined in terms of $f_{A_2}^{--}$ using the action of the $A_3$ automorphism generators. It is given by 
\begin{align}
f_{A_3}^{+-}(x_1\to x_2\to x_3) &= \sum_{i=1}^6 \sigma_{A_3}^i\big(f_{A_2}^{--}(x_1\to x_2)\big),
\end{align}
where $\sigma_{A_3}^i$ denotes applying the operator $\sigma_{A_3}$ $i$ times. In seven-particle kinematics, $f_{A_3}^{+-}$ gave rise to a unique decomposition of $\smash{\delta_{2,2}\big( R_7^{(2)}\big)}$. Moreover, as depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:R27_decompositions}, the subalgebras appearing in this seven-particle decomposition came in the right linear combination to combine into specific instances of the function $f_{A_5}^{--}$, defined by
\begin{equation}
	f_{A_3\subset A_5}^{--}\big( x_1\to x_2\to x_3 \to x_4  \to x_5 \big) = - \frac{1}{8}\sum_{A_5^{--}} f_{A_3}^{+-}\left(x_2\to x_3(1+x_4)\to \frac{x_4 x_5}{1+x_4}\right) \, ,
\end{equation}
where we have used the notation
\begin{equation}
\sum_{A_5^{--}} f  \equiv \sum_{i=0}^7 \sum_{j=0}^1 (-1)^{i+j} \ \sigma_{A_5}^i \circ \tau_{A_5}^j \big(f \big)
\end{equation}
to denote the the totally antisymmetric sum over all dihedral images of the $A_5$ cluster algebra.\footnote{Note that this is just one version of the $A_5$ function $f_{A_5}^{--}$ encountered in seven-particle kinematics; there, a variant that could be decomposed into $f_{A_4}^{+-}$ was also found.} 


As it turns out, both of these features generalize to eight-particle kinematics: there exists a unique decomposition of $\smash{\delta_{2,2}\big( R_8^{(2)}\big)}$ in terms of $ f_{A_3}^{+-}$ functions, and these $A_3$ functions come in the right linear combination to form instances of $f_{A_3\subset A_5}^{--}$. In terms of the latter functions, the decomposition is given by
\begin{align}\label{eq:r28A5}
\delta_{2,2} \big(R^{(2)}_8\big) &= \frac{1}{40} \sum_{i = 0}^7 \sum_{j=0}^1 \sum_{k=0}^1 \ \sigma_{\Gr(4,8)}^i \circ \tau_{\Gr(4,8)}^j \circ {\mathcal{P}}_{\Gr(4,8)}^j   \Big(\delta_{2,2} \big(F_{A_5} \big)\Big) \, ,
\end{align}
where 
\begin{align} \label{eq:F_A5}
F_{A_5} &= f_{A_3\subset A_5}^{--}\! \left(\tfrac{\langle 1238 \rangle \langle 2345 \rangle}{\langle 1234 \rangle \langle 2358 \rangle} \! 
    \to \! \tfrac{- \langle 1235 \rangle \langle 4568 \rangle}{\langle 5(18)(23)(46) \rangle} \! 
    \to \!\tfrac{\langle 1568 \rangle \langle 2358 \rangle \langle 3456 \rangle}{\langle 1358 \rangle \langle 2356 \rangle \langle 4568 \rangle} \! 
    \to \!\tfrac{\langle 5(18)(23)(46) \rangle}{- \langle 1258 \rangle \langle 3456 \rangle} \! 
    \to \!\tfrac{\langle 1278 \rangle \langle 1358 \rangle}{\langle 1238 \rangle \langle 1578 \rangle}\right)\nonumber\\
   &\quad - \frac12 f_{A_3\subset A_5}^{--} \! \left(\tfrac{\langle 1238\rangle  \langle 1256\rangle }{\langle1235\rangle  \langle 1268\rangle }\! 
    \to \! \tfrac{\langle 1236 \rangle \langle 2345 \rangle}{\langle 1234 \rangle \langle 2356 \rangle} \! 
    \to \! \tfrac{\langle 1235 \rangle \langle 3456 \rangle}{\langle 1356 \rangle \langle 234 5\rangle} \! 
    \to \! \tfrac{\langle 1567 \rangle \langle 2356 \rangle}{\langle 1256 \rangle \langle 3567 \rangle} \! 
    \to \! \tfrac{\langle 1356 \rangle \langle 4567 \rangle}{\langle 1567 \rangle \langle 3456 \rangle}\right)  , 
\end{align}
and the sum ranges over all the dihedral and parity images of $F_{A_5}$ in $\Gr(4,8)$. Explicitly, the generators of the dihedral group act on generic four-brackets as
\begin{align} \label{eq:Gr_4n_dihedral_generators}
  \sigma_{\Gr(4,n)} :\quad  \langle i j k l \rangle \ \ &\to \ \ \langle i{+}1 \,  j{+}1 \,  k{+}1 \,  l{+}1 \rangle \, , \\
  \tau_{\Gr(4,n)} :\quad  \langle i j k l \rangle  \ \ &\to \ \  \langle n{-}i{+}1 \, n{-}j{+}1\, n{-}k{+}1 \, n{-}l{+}1 \rangle \, ,
\end{align}
while parity acts on the four-brackets that appear in the symbol as  
\vspace{.7cm}
\begin{align} \label{eq:Gr_4n_parity} \ \end{align}
\vspace{-2.6cm}
\begin{align} 
  \mathcal{P}_{\Gr(4,n)} :  \begin{cases} 
	\ket{i \, i{+}1 \, j \, k} \ \ \to\ \ \ket{\bar{i} \, i{+}2}\ket{i \, i{+}1 \, \bar{j}\cap\bar{k}} \\
	\ket{i \, i{+}1 \, \bar{j}\cap\bar{k}} \ \ \to \ \ \ket{j{-}2 \, \bar{j}} \ket{\bar{j} \, j{+}2} \ket{k{-}2 \, \bar{k}} \ket{\bar{k} \, k{+}2} \ket{\bar{i} \, i{+}2}\ket{i \, i{+}1 \, j \, k} \\
	\ket{i \, (i{-}1 \, i{+}1)(j \, j{+}1)(k \,k{+}1)} \\ 
	\qquad \qquad \to \ \ \ket{\bar{i} \, i{+}2} \ket{i{-}2 \, \bar{i}} \ket{\bar{j} \, j{+}2} \ket{\bar{k} \, k{+}2} \ket{i \, (i{-}1 \, i{+}1)(j \, j{+}1)(k \, k{+}1)} \\
	\ket{i \, (i{-}2 \, i{-}1)(i{+}1 \, i{+}2)(j \, j{+}1)} \\ 
	\qquad \qquad \to \ \ \ket{\overline{i{-}2} \, i} \ket{i{-}2 \, \bar{i}} \ket{\bar{i} \, i{+}2} \ket{i \, \overline{i{+}2}} \ket{\bar{j} \, j{+}2} \ket{j \, j{+}1 \, i{-}1\, i{+}1}\, ,
  \end{cases} \nonumber
\end{align}
where we have used the notation introduced in~\eqref{eq:abbrev_1} and~\eqref{eq:abbrev_2}, as well as $\bar{i}=(i{-}1\,i\,i{+}1)$. All four-bracket entries should be understood mod $n$. 

The decomposition~\eqref{eq:r28A5} only involves 24 of the $A_5$ subalgebras appearing in Table~\ref{table:subalgebra_counts}, as the $A_5$ cluster algebra appearing in the first term in~\eqref{eq:F_A5} generates a sixteen-orbit under the action of the dihedral group and parity, while the $A_5$ cluster algebra appearing in the second term only generates an eight-orbit (and thus gets counted twice, explaining the relative factor of two). Although we will not discuss collinear limits in detail until section~\ref{sec:collinear_limits}, it is also worth commenting on how this decomposition limits to the $A_5$ decomposition of the seven-particle remainder function found in~\cite{Golden:2018gtk}. In the limit in which two adjacent external momenta become collinear, 15 of the 24 $f_{A_3\subset A_5}^{--}$ functions vanish (at the level of the $\delta_{2,2}$ cobracket), while two have residual dependence on how the collinear limit is parametrized (more specifically, on the parameters $\epsilon$, $\alpha$, and $\beta$ that will appear in equation~\ref{eq:collinear_parametrization}). However, the two functions with spurious dependence are equal and opposite, and thus cancel out to leave just the 7 $f_{A_3\subset A_5}^{--}$ functions that were observed at seven points.  

\paragraph{The Nine-Particle Remainder Function}~\\[-10pt]

\noindent Despite the existence of unique, nested $A_2 \subset A_3 \subset A_5 \subset \Gr(4,n)$ decompositions at both seven and eight points, no $A_5$ decomposition of the nine-particle remainder function exists (at least in terms of the subalgebras cataloged in Table~\ref{table:subalgebra_counts}). However, there still exists a unique decomposition in terms of $f_{A_3}^{+-}$ functions. It is given by
\begin{align}\label{eq:r29A3}
\delta_{2,2} \big(R^{(2)}_9\big) &= \frac{1}{80} \sum_{i = 0}^8 \sum_{j=0}^1 \sum_{k=0}^1 \ \sigma_{\Gr(4,9)}^i \circ \tau_{\Gr(4,9)}^j \circ {\mathcal{P}}_{\Gr(4,9)}^j   \Big(\delta_{2,2} \big(F_{A_3} \big)\Big) \, ,
\end{align}
where the sum is over all dihedral and parity images of $F_{A_3}$ in $\Gr(4,9)$, and

All of the $A_3$ cluster algebras appearing in $F_{A_3}$ generate eighteen-orbits under the dihedral group and parity, except for the last term which only generates a six-orbit (hence the factor of one third). 

In collinear limits, 46 of the 168 $f_{A_3}^{+-}$ functions appearing in~\eqref{eq:r29A3} vanish, while 42 of them have spurious dependence on the parametrization of the collinear limit but cancel pairwise. This leaves 80 $A_3$ functions, which correctly assemble into the 24 $A_5$ functions described by~\eqref{eq:r28A5} after some cancellations between these $A_5$ functions are taken into account.

%It is again worth emphasizing that the decompositions of $\delta_{2,2}\big(R_7^{(2)}\big)$, $\delta_{2,2}\big(R_8^{(2)}\big)$, and $\delta_{2,2}\big(R_9^{(2)}\big)$ in terms of $f_{A_3}^{+-}$ functions are all unique. It is thus tempting to believe that a unique decomposition will also exist for all higher $n$.

\section{Complete Polylogarithmic Representations of \pdfeq{R_8^{(2)}} and \pdfeq{R_9^{(2)}}}
\label{sec:r28_and_r29}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this section we construct complete polylogarithmic representations of $R_8^{(2)}$\! and $R_9^{(2)}$\!, starting from the nonclassical polylogarithms in~\eqref{eq:r28A5} and~\eqref{eq:r29A3} that reproduce their $\delta_{2,2}$ cobracket values. This is done by isolating their different classical components with the use of the projection operators described in section~\ref{sec:lie_cobracket}, and separately fitting each of these components to an appropriate ansatz.
%To do this, we isolate the contributions coming from different types of classical polylogarithms with the use of the projection operators described in section~\ref{sec:lie_cobracket}, and sequentially fit each of these these functional components to an appropriate ansatz. 
%of classical polylogarithms with negative cluster coordinate arguments. 
%We then determine the contributions proportional to $\zeta_2$ using knowledge of the differentials $dR_n^{(2)}$\!~\cite{Golden:2013lha}, and fix the contribution proportional to $\zeta_4$ by evaluating each function in the collinear limit and comparing to lower-point results.
The contributions proportional to transcendental constants can then be determined using knowledge of the differentials $dR_n^{(2)}$\!~\cite{CaronHuot:2011ky,Golden:2013lha}, and by evaluating each function in the collinear limit and comparing it to lower-point results.


%then express all remaining contributions to the differentials of these functions in terms of a basis of classical polylogarithms with negative cluster coordinate arguments. Both of these steps are carried out with the help of the cobracket and projection operators described in section~\ref{sec:lie_cobracket}, which allow us to fit the different functional components of these differentials separately, greatly reducing the computational load. Finally, we determine the integration constants by evaluating these functions in the collinear limit and comparing to lower-point results.

%\subsection{Subalgebra Constructibility of the Nonclassical Contributions}

\subsection{Classical Contributions}

Once a polylogarithm with the same nonclassical component as $R_n^{(2)}$\! is known, the contributions from classical polylogarithms can be determined systematically using the methods described in~\cite{Goncharov:2010jf,Golden:2014xqf}. The first step of this procedure is to isolate the additional contribution coming from classical polylogarithms of weight four. As described in section~\ref{sec:lie_cobracket}, this can be done by computing the $\delta_{3,1}$ cobracket component of the difference between the symbol of $R_n^{(2)}$\! and the polylogarithm chosen to match its $\delta_{2,2}$ component. We then upgrade this residual $\delta_{3,1}$ contribution to a sum of weight-four classical polylogarithms by utilizing the expectation that the remainder function is expressible in terms of polylogarithms with negative $\x$-coordinate arguments. That is, we construct an ansatz of weight-four classical polylogarithms with arguments drawn from the list of negative $\x$-coordinates that appear in the symbol of $R_n^{(2)}$\!, and fix the coefficients of this ansatz by requiring it to have the required $\delta_{3,1}$ cobracket value.

The contributions coming from products of lower-weight classical polylogarithms can be determined using a similar procedure---we isolate each functional component using the projection operators defined in section~\ref{sec:lie_cobracket} (after subtracting off all previously-determined contributions), and fit it to an appropriate ansatz. In formulating these ans\"atze, it behooves us to first reduce the number of lower-weight classical polylogarithms we need to include. In particular, while the sets of weight-three and weight-four classical polylogarithms with (negative) $\x$-coordinate arguments drawn from the symbols of $R_8^{(2)}$\! and $R_9^{(2)}$\! don't prove to be massively overcomplete, the weight-two and weight-one polylogarithms (unsurprisingly) are. Correspondingly, for use in our ans\"atze, we construct a (close to) minimal spanning set of this collection of weight-two classical polylogarithms (modulo products of logarithms). (We don't use a minimal set, because we still want the resulting set of functions to have nice properties under dihedral and parity transformations.) And at weight one, we work directly in terms of logarithms of $\a$-coordinates, and only later recombine these logarithms into functions of $\x$-coordinates.  

In this way, starting from the nonclassical polylogarithms in~\eqref{eq:r28A5} and~\eqref{eq:r29A3}, we iteratively build up polylogarithmic functions that reproduce the full symbols of $R_8^{(2)}$\! and $R_9^{(2)}$\!. This requires solving some extremely large systems of linear equations. For instance, the ansatz for the $\Li_2(x) \log y  \log z$ contribution to the nine-particle remainder function, constructed as described above, spans a space of dimension 26904528.\footnote{More precisely, this corresponds to the number of independent DCI degrees of freedom that survive after applying the projection operator~\eqref{eq:proj_op_3}, which maps the dilogarithms to elements of the Bloch group $B_2$.} However, this linear system can be split into different sectors by separating out terms that depend on different pairs of logarithms; these sectors don't mix under the action of the projection operator~\eqref{eq:proj_op_3} as long as all other functional components involving classical polylogarithms of weight two and higher have already been fit and subtracted off. This breaks the problem into 23436 smaller systems of equations, each involving just 1148 degrees of freedom. We also fit the $\Li_2(x) \Li_2(y)$ component using a more tailored ansatz, since this component is known to be expressible in terms of dilogarithms evaluated on a reduced set of $\x$-coordinates (see equation (14) of~\cite{Golden:2014pua}).

After the full symbol of $R_n^{(2)}$\! has been upgraded to a function, the contributions proportional to lower-weight transcendental constants can easily be determined by comparing to the (known) differential of the remainder function, $dR_n^{(2)}$\!~\cite{CaronHuot:2011ky,Golden:2013lha}. Since only $\zeta_2$ appears in these differentials, no other lower-weight constants are needed. Once these $\zeta_2$ terms are incorporated and all logarithms have been recombined to have $\x$-coordinate arguments, our functions involve 4146605 and 51322359 terms and eight and nine points, respectively.\footnote{It is worth noting that the length of these expressions can be brought down multiple orders of magnitude by going to a fibration bais~\cite{Brown:2009qja}. However, since we don't have an \emph{a priori} guess for a minimal set of functions of the latter type that the remainder function can be expressed in terms of, these overly large representations constitute a necessary intermediate step.}

\subsection{Collinear Limits}
\label{sec:collinear_limits}

The only contributions to $R_8^{(2)}$\! and $R_9^{(2)}$\! that remain to be determined are the weight-four constants. Since the remainder function is smooth in collinear limits, namely
\begin{equation} \label{eq:remainder_smooth_collinear_limits}
R_n \xrightarrow[]{p_i || p_{i+1}} R_{n-1} \, ,
\end{equation} 
these contributions can be determined analytically by computing the difference between the collinear limit of each of these functions and the remainder function involving one fewer leg. Thus, we first fix the constant in $R_8^{(2)}$\! by comparing its collinear limit to the known value of $R_7^{(2)}$\!~\cite{Golden:2014xqf}, after which we can similarly fix the constant in $R_9^{(2)}$\!. 


Following~\cite{CaronHuot:2011ky}, we parametrize the $R_n^{(2)} \to R_{n-1}^{(2)}$ limit in terms of momentum twistors by
\begin{equation} \label{eq:collinear_parametrization}
Z_n \to Z_{n-1} - \epsilon (\alpha Z_1 + \beta Z_{n-2}) + \epsilon^2 Z_2 \, ,
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon \to 0$, and $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are finite and positive. This parametrization keeps us inside the positive region, and thus ensures we don't cross any branch cuts. Since the $(n{-}1)$-particle amplitude depends on three fewer kinematic degrees of freedom than the $n$-particle amplitude, all three parameters $\epsilon$, $\alpha$, and $\beta$ must drop out in the strict $\epsilon \to 0$ limit. This requirement provides an important cross-check on the functional form of our answers.

To take the collinear limit of our current functions, we substitute the parametrization of $Z_n$ in~\eqref{eq:collinear_parametrization} into all $\x$-coordinates and send $\epsilon \to 0$. This gives rise to a number of polylogarithms with vanishing or divergent arguments. In the case of classical polylogarithms, these arguments can be dealt with using the fact that $\Li_k(0) = 0$, or using the expansions
\begin{align}
\Li_2(-x/\epsilon) &\xrightarrow[]{\epsilon \to 0} - \frac{1}{2} \big(\log(\epsilon) - \log (x) \big)^2  - \zeta_2 \, ,\\
\Li_3(-x/\epsilon) &\xrightarrow[]{\epsilon \to 0}  \frac{1}{6} \big(\log(\epsilon) - \log (x) \big)^3 + 
\big(\log(\epsilon) - \log (x) \big) \zeta_2   \, ,\\
\Li_4(-x/\epsilon) &\xrightarrow[]{\epsilon \to 0}  -\frac{1}{24} \big(\log(\epsilon) - \log (x) \big)^4 - 
  \frac{1}{2} \big(\log(\epsilon) - \log (x) \big)^2 \zeta_2 - \frac{7}{4} \zeta_4  \, ,
\end{align} 
which are valid for positive $x$ and $\epsilon$. The only linear combinations of nonclassical polylogarithms that appear in our functions are $\Li_{2, 2}(x, y) - \Li_{1, 3}(x, y)$, as seen in the first line of~\eqref{def:a2-function}. This function vanishes when either of the arguments $x$ or $y$ goes to zero, even if the other argument diverges at the same rate. As it turns out, we never encounter instances of $\Li_{2, 2}(x, y) - \Li_{1, 3}(x, y)$ in which one of the arguments diverges while the other remains finite (or itself diverges), so we never need to expand these functions around infinity. 

In order to see the dependence on $\epsilon$, $\alpha$, and $\beta$ drop out in this limit, we must take into account a large number of nontrivial polylogarithmic identities, such as
\begin{align}
\Li_{2, 2}(-x, -1/x) - \Li_{1, 3}(-x, -1/x) &=  \Li_{2, 2}(-1/x, -x) - \Li_{1, 3}(-1/x, -x)  \nonumber \\
&\quad  + 10 \Li_4(-x)  - \frac{1}{2} \Li_2(-x) \left( \log(x)^2 + 14 \zeta_2 \right)   \\ &\quad  - \frac{1}{6} \Li_1(- x) \log(x) \left( \log(x)^2 + 6 \zeta_2 \right) \, .   \nonumber
\end{align}
Rather than find all such identities explicitly, we evaluate the four-brackets in all $\x$-coordinates on an explicit momentum twister parameterization, which allows us to express our functions in terms of a fibration basis in these parameters~\cite{Brown:2009qja}. (This can be done using publicly-available codes~\cite{Panzer:2014caa,Duhr:2019tlz}.) In addition to seeing the parameters $\epsilon$, $\alpha$, and $\beta$ drop out, this makes the comparison to the lower-point remainder function easier, since we can express both functions in the same fibration basis.

Using this procedure, we have analytically determined the constant contributions to $R_8^{(2)}$\! and $R_9^{(2)}$\!, both of which are proportional to $\zeta_4$ (as expected). The specific coefficients of $\zeta_4$ in these functions can be found in the ancillary files, but aren't meaningful in isolation (as they can be shifted with the use of polylogarithmic identities). This completes our determination of the two-loop eight- and nine-particle MHV amplitudes.

\section{Numerical Results and Cross-Checks}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

One of the benefits of having a full polylogarithmic representation of the $n$-particle remainder function is that it makes it easier to get numerical results for the corresponding amplitude. Studying such numerics helps us better understand the behavior of these amplitudes, and in the present context also provides an important cross-check on our analytic determination of the $\zeta_4$ contributions to $R_8^{(2)}$\! and $R_9^{(2)}$\!. As we will see below, our new representations of the eight- and nine-particle remainder functions indeed limit to the correct numerical values along lines that approach collinear limits.

We restrict our numerical explorations to the positive region, where our functional representations are manifestly real. In~\cite{Galashin:2017onl}, it was shown that this region is homeomorphic to a ball centered at the point corresponding to the four-bracket values
\begin{align}
\langle i j k l \rangle \big|_{\text{sym}(n)} &= \sin\left(\frac{(l - k) \pi}{n} \right) \sin\left(\frac{(l - j) \pi}{n} \right) \sin\left(\frac{(l - i) \pi}{n}\right) \nonumber \\
&\qquad \times \sin\left(\frac{(k - j) \pi}{n}\right) \sin\left(\frac{(k - i) \pi}{n}\right) \sin\left(\frac{(j - i) \pi}{n}\right) \, . \label{eq:symmetric_point}
\end{align}
This point is dihedrally symmetric in $n$-particle kinematics. Drawing upon known representations for the two-loop six- and seven-particle remainder functions~\cite{DelDuca:2009au,DelDuca:2010zg,Goncharov:2010jf,Golden:2014xqf}, we have evaluated $R_n^{(2)}$ for all $n \leq n^\prime \leq 9$ on the four-bracket values $\langle i j k l \rangle \big|_{\text{sym}(n^\prime)}$; the results are presented in Table~\ref{table:symmetric_point_numerics}. While the  remainder function does not in general evaluate to a linear combination of nice transcendental constants at these points (such as multiple polylogarithms evaluated at sixth roots of unity), we can still use these numerical values to check that the $n$-particle remainder function limits to the correct lower-point values when $Z_n \to Z_{n-1}$.

\label{table:symmetric_point_numerics}
\end{center}
\end{table}

To check this limiting behavior, we parametrize a line between the totally-dihedral point in $n$-particle kinematics, and the point in $(n{-}1)$-particle kinematics that corresponds to sending $Z_n \to Z_{n-1}$. In order to do so, we first solve
\begin{equation} \label{eq:totally_symmetric_parameters}
\Big[ \langle i j k n \rangle = a\, \langle i j k \, n{-}1 \rangle - b\, \langle i  j  k 1 \rangle - c\, \langle i j k \, n{-}2 \rangle + d\, \langle i j k 2 \rangle \Big]_{\text{sym}(n)} 
\end{equation}
for $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ by plugging in various values of $i$, $j$, and $k$ and evaluating these four-brackets on~\eqref{eq:symmetric_point}. This just amounts to expanding the momentum twistor $Z_n$ in terms of the twistors $Z_1$, $Z_2$, $Z_{n-2}$, and $Z_{n-1}$ at this kinematic point, and thus any four independent equations will give the same result. We then adopt the parametrization
\begin{equation} \label{eq:line_parametrization}
Z_n = a\, Z_{n-1} - x (b\, Z_1 + c\, Z_{n-2}) + x^2 \, d \, Z_2 \, , \qquad 0 < x \leq 1
\end{equation}
which (using the values for $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ determined by~\eqref{eq:totally_symmetric_parameters}) reproduces the dihedrally symmetric point~\eqref{eq:symmetric_point} when $x$ is 1, and approaches the collinear limit in an appropriate manner as $x \to 0$. In particular, the $n$-particle remainder function should numerically approach the value of the $(n{-}1)$-point remainder function evaluated on $\langle i j k l \rangle \big|_{\text{sym}(n)}$ as $x \to 0$.

More generally, the parametrization in~\eqref{eq:line_parametrization} can be used to move between any initial point in $n$-particle kinematics and the point in $(n{-}1)$-particle kinematics that corresponds to forgetting the twistor $Z_n$. One merely solves the constraint
\begin{equation}
\Big[ \langle i j k n \rangle = a\, \langle i j k \, n{-}1 \rangle - b\, \langle i  j  k 1 \rangle - c\, \langle i j k \, n{-}2 \rangle + d\, \langle i j k 2 \rangle \Big] 
\end{equation}
for $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ on the four-bracket values corresponding to the desired initial point in $n$-particle kinematics, instead of at the dihedrally-symmetric point. In this way, starting from any initial kinematic point, we can use the parametrization~\eqref{eq:line_parametrization} to iteratively take collinear limits until we approach a point in five-particle kinematics, where the remainder function must vanish. Note that we always apply the parametrization~\eqref{eq:line_parametrization} to the momentum twistor with the highest index $n$, so this prescription associates a unique line from every kinematic point (in arbitrarily high-point kinematics) down to five- (or lower-)point kinematics.

\end{figure}

We now focus on the lines this prescription associates with the dihedrally-symmetric points in six-, seven-, eight-, and nine-particle kinematics. The value of the remainder function along these lines is plotted in Figure~\ref{fig:symm_to_collinear_lines}. Since these lines are parametrized piecewise (with different segments corresponding to kinematics involving different numbers of particles), a kink naturally appears each time the parametrization~\eqref{eq:line_parametrization} approaches a collinear limit. However, what is important is that the endpoints of the line segments in adjacent kinematic regions limit to a common value, in accordance with~\eqref{eq:remainder_smooth_collinear_limits}.\footnote{We have shifted the line segments appearing in Figures~\ref{fig:symm_to_collinear_lines} and~\ref{fig:random_point_to_collinear_lines} along the $x$ axis in order to emphasize that their endpoints appropriately limit to common values; for instance, the values of $R_9^{(2)}$\! corresponding to $0 < x \leq 1$ in~\eqref{eq:line_parametrization} are given in the range $3 < x \leq 4$ in these plots.} In particular, the values at which these line segments meet are precisely those reported in Table~\ref{table:symmetric_point_numerics}. For instance, the line associated with the totally symmetric point in nine-particle kinematics is shown on the bottom right of Figure~\ref{fig:symm_to_collinear_lines}. The rightmost point on this line depicts the value of $R_9^{(2)}$\! when evaluated on $\langle i j k l \rangle \big|_{\text{sym}(9)}$, while the kinks one encounters as one moves to the left occur at the values of $R_8^{(2)}$\!, $R_7^{(2)}$\!, and $R_6^{(2)}$\! evaluated on the same four-bracket values. Finally, the remainder function vanishes at the leftmost point on this line, which corresponds to a point in five-particle kinematics. The fact that each of the line segments in this plot (and the other plots) limits to the correct value of the lower-point remainder function provides a nontrivial check on our determination of $R_8^{(2)}$\! and $R_9^{(2)}$\!.

    \label{fig:random_point_to_collinear_lines}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

In Figure~\ref{fig:symm_to_collinear_lines}, we see that the remainder function decreases monotonically as one moves away from the dihedrally-symmetric points given in~\eqref{eq:symmetric_point} along the lines parametrized by~\eqref{eq:line_parametrization}.\footnote{We note, however, that the remainder function is not at a local maximum at these dihedrally-symmetric points~\eqref{eq:symmetric_point}.} Moreover, the line segments appearing in this figure all take approximately the same shape. This can be contrasted with Figure~\ref{fig:random_point_to_collinear_lines}, where we have plotted the remainder function on the line starting at a randomly chosen point in nine-particle kinematics, given by the momentum twistor matrix
\begin{equation} \label{eq:random_kinematic_point}
\left(
\begin{array}{ccccccccc}
 1 & \frac{57}{16} & \frac{53773}{1024} & \frac{8965489}{94208} & \frac{4259781}{94208} & \frac{123975}{23552} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
 0 & 1 & \frac{30377}{32} & \frac{43566331}{20608} & \frac{24024151}{20608} & \frac{978025}{5152} & \frac{13775}{644} & 0 & 0 \\
 0 & 0 & 1 & \frac{16043}{7140} & \frac{8903}{7140} & \frac{377}{1785} & \frac{1276}{41055} & \frac{58}{8211} & 0 \\
 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
\end{array}
\right).
\end{equation}
We see there that, while the endpoints of adjacent line segments appropriately limit to common values, the remainder function exhibits more erratic behavior in general. However, the value of the remainder function still increases, on average, as one moves to higher $n$. It would be interesting to know if this is a generic feature of these amplitudes, or even of lines iteratively parametrized via~\eqref{eq:line_parametrization}.

As an additional cross-check, we have we have evaluated our expressions for $R_8^{(2)}$\! near one of its `origins' (a singular, codimension-six surface analogous to the origin of the six-point amplitude as studied in~\cite{Basso:2020xts}) and have found exact (analytic) agreement with the expression independently computed by~\cite{Lance_correspondance}. This check, in combination with the numerical checks presented above, give us high confidence in our results.\footnote{It would also have been interesting to compare to the numerical results of~\cite{Anastasiou:2009kna,Brandhuber:2009da} or the analytic results in special kinematics studied in~\cite{DelDuca:2010zp,Heslop:2010kq,Gaiotto:2010fk}, but these configurations are either off the support of Gram determinant constraints or far outside the positive region, making them harder to access with our results.}

\section{Conclusion}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this paper, we have finished the computation of the two-loop eight- and nine-particle remainder functions, upgrading their symbols to complete polylogarithmic functions. To do so, we have made use of the extensive and well-studied cluster-algebraic structure enjoyed by these amplitudes, in particular making use of the algorithm described in~\cite{Golden:2014xqf}. Our representations of these amplitudes are manifestly real in the positive region, making them well-suited to numerical evaluation there. Leveraging this fact, we have computed the value of the remainder function at the unique diherally-symmetric point in the positive region at each multiplicity, and explore the behavior of the remainder function along lines that successively approach collinear limits from this point.

In constructing these functions, we have also explored the subalgebra constructibility of the eight- and nine-particle remainder function, extending the analyses of~\cite{Golden:2014xqa,Golden:2018gtk}. While exhaustive surveys for such decompositions are no longer possible for these particle multiplicities (since the underlying cluster algebras are infinite), we have searched for all possible decompositions involving the $\x$-coordinates that appear in the symbol of each function. We find a unique $A_5$ decomposition of this type for the eight-particle remainder function, as there was at seven points, but no such $A_5$ decomposition at nine points. More encouragingly, we find a unique $A_3$ decomposition in terms of the function $f_{A_3}^{+-}$ exists for each of seven, eight, and nine particles. We suspect that this indicates the existence of an infinite tower of unique $A_3$ decompositions at all multiplicities; if so, it would be interesting to find a closed-form expression for this decomposition at all $n$.\footnote{Perhaps the recently-introduced class of `clean single-valued polylogarithms' could be useful for finding such a decomposition~\cite{Charlton:2021uhu}.}

While many of the features that we have leveraged in our analysis seem to be unique to the two-loop MHV amplitudes of planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ sYM, it remains worth considering whether similar techniques could be applied to closely-related classes of amplitudes. For instance, the symbols of the NMHV amplitudes in this theory can now be computed at any multiplicity~\cite{Zhang:2019vnm,He:2020vob}, while the integrand of the nonplanar two-loop MHV amplitude is known in terms of a basis of just six Feynman integrals to all multiplicity~\cite{Bourjaily:2019iqr,Bourjaily:2019gqu}. Although neither of these classes of amplitudes is expected to exhibit the same type of cluster-algebraic structure as the amplitudes studied in this paper, it remains possible that the Lie cobracket of these other amplitudes could exhibit different types of structure that could be leveraged in a similar way.

\noindent Similar to the eight-particle momentum-twistor matrix, the $p_9 || p_8$ collinear limit is taken by sending $f_{10}, f_{11}, f_{12} \to 0$, which sets the first eight columns of $Z_9$ to $Z_8$. 


The eight-point amplitude is a function of twelve multiplicatively-independent cross-ratios
\begin{align}
u_i = u_{i,i+3}, \qquad v_i = u_{i,i+4} \, ,
\end{align}
where the $u_i$ variables form an eight-orbit and the $v_i$ variables form a four-orbit under the dihedral group. Note that $u_i = u_{i,i+3}$ and $v_i =  u_{i,i+4}$ in the notation of~\cite{Anastasiou:2009kna}. These cross-ratios are subject to a number of Gram determinant constraints, which leave only nine of them algebraically independent.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Dual-Conformal Remainder Functions in Eight-Particle Kinematics}

\draftnote{Paragraph introducing the BDS ansatz}

When the number of particles $n$ is not a multiple of four, a unique BDS-like ansatz can be defined that depends on just two-particle Mandelstam invariants. That is, there exists just a single decomposition of the BDS ansatz into
\begin{equation}
{\cal A}_n^{\text{BDS}}(\{\mand{i,\dots,i+j}\}) = {\cal A}_n^{\text{BDS-like}}(\{\mand{i,i+1}\}) \exp \left[ - \frac{\Gamma_{\text{cusp}}}{4} Y_{n}(\{u_i\})  \right], \quad n\neq4K,
\end{equation}
such that the kinematic dependence of $A^{\text{BDS-like}}_{n}$ involves only two-particle Mandelstam invariants while $Y_{n}$ depends only on dual-conformal-invariant cross ratios~\cite{Yang:2010az}. %In particular, at one loop this relation becomes
%\begin{equation}
%A^{\text{BDS},(1)}_{n} = A^{\text{BDS-like},(1)}_{n}(\{\mand{i,i+1}\}) + Y_{n}(\{u_i\}), \quad n\neq4K,
%\end{equation}
When $n$ is a multiple of four, no decomposition of this type exists, and we are forced to consider multiple BDS-like ans\"atze if we want to transparently expose the full space of Steinmann relations between higher-particle Mandelstam invariants. 

In eight-particle kinematics, there are still two natural BDS-like normalization choices we might consider. Namely, we can let our BDS-like ansatz depend on either three- or four-particle Mandelstam invariants in addition to two-particle invariants~\cite{Dixon:2016nkn}. In this spirit, let us define a pair of BDS-like ans\"atze, respectively satisfying
\begin{align}
{\cal A}_8^{\text{BDS}}(\{\mand{i,\dots,i+j}\}) &= {}^4 {\cal A}_8^{\text{BDS-like}}(\{\mand{i,i+1}\}, \{\mand{i,i+1,i+2,i+3}\}) \exp \left[ -\frac{\Gamma_{\text{cusp}}}{4}\ {}^4 Y_{8}(\{u_i\})  \right], \label{bds_like_4} \\
%{\cal A}^{\text{BDS},(1)}_{n} &= {}^3 {\cal A}^{\text{BDS-like},(1)}_{8}(\{\mand{i,i+1}\}, \{\mand{i,i+1,i+2,i+3}\}) + {}^3 Y_{8}(\{u_i\}), \\
{\cal A}_8^{\text{BDS}}(\{\mand{i,\dots,i+j}\}) &= {}^3 {\cal A}_8^{\text{BDS-like}}(\{\mand{i,i+1}\}, \{\mand{i,i+1,i+2}\}) \exp \left[ - \frac{\Gamma_{\text{cusp}}}{4}\ {}^3 Y_{8}(\{u_i\})  \right]. \label{bds_like_3}
%{\cal A}^{\text{BDS},(1)}_{n} &= {}^4 {\cal A}^{\text{BDS-like},(1)}_{8}(\{\mand{i,i+1}\}, \{\mand{i,i+1,i+2}\}) + {}^4 Y_{8}(\{u_i\}). 
\end{align}
The functions ${}^4 A^{\text{BDS-like}}_{8}$ and ${}^3 A^{\text{BDS-like}}_{8}$ are not uniquely fixed by these decomposition choices; each admits a family of Bose-symmetric (and a larger family of non-Bose-symmetric) solutions. However, any choice for ${}^4 A^{\text{BDS-like}}_{8}$ or ${}^3 A^{\text{BDS-like}}_{8}$ consistent with eqns.~\eqref{bds_like_4} or \eqref{bds_like_3} gives rise to a BDS-like normalized amplitude that manifestly exhibits a subset of the Steinmann relations. In particular, defining
\begin{equation}
{}^X {\cal E}_8 \equiv \frac{{\cal A}_8^{\text{MHV}}}{{}^X {\cal A}^{\text{BDS-like}}_{8}} = \exp\left[ R_8 - \frac{\Gamma_{\text{cusp}}}{4} \  {}^X Y_8 \right] \label{BDS_like_amplitude}
\end{equation}
for any label $X$, we expect that ${}^4 {\cal E}_8$ should satisfy Steinmann relations between all partially overlapping pairs of three-particle invariants, while ${}^3 {\cal E}_8$ should satisfy Steinmann relations between all partially overlapping pairs of four-particle invariants. That is, ${}^4 {\cal E}_8$ is expected to satisfy the relations
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\text{Disc}_{\mand{j,j+1,j+2}}\left[\text{Disc}_{\mand{i,i+1,i+2}} \big({}^4 {\cal E}_8 \big) \right] &= 0, \quad  j \in \{ i \pm 2, i \pm 1 \}, \label{stein33}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
while ${}^3 {\cal E}_8$ is expected to satisfy
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\text{Disc}_{\mand{j,j+1,j+2,j+3}}\left[\text{Disc}_{\mand{i,i+1,i+2,i+3}} \big({}^3 {\cal E}_8 \big) \right] &= 0, \quad j \in \{ i \pm 3, i \pm 2, i \pm 1 \}.  \label{stein44}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Due to momentum conservation in eight-point kinematics, the six relations in~\eqref{stein44} corresponding to a given $i$ only result in three independent constraints; however, these relations will be independent for larger $n$.

Although the functions ${}^4 Y_{8}$ and ${}^3 Y_{8}$ are not unique, their dilogarithmic part is completely determined by the decompositions~\eqref{bds_like_4} and~\eqref{bds_like_3}. They can be expressed as classical polylogarithms with negative arguments drawn from \begin{align}
\mathfrak{X}_{i,8} &= \frac{\langle i,i+1,i+2,i+4 \rangle \langle i+1,i+3,i+4,i+5\rangle}{\langle i,i+1,i+4,i+5 \rangle \langle i+1,i+2,i+3,i+4 \rangle}, \\
\mathfrak{X}_{i,4} &= \frac{\langle i,i+1,i+4,i+7 \rangle \langle i,i+3,i+4,i+5 \rangle}{\langle i,i+1,i+3,i+4 \rangle \langle i,i+4,i+5,i+7 \rangle},
\end{align}
where $\mathfrak{X}_{i,8}$ and $\mathfrak{X}_{i,4}$ are ${\cal X}$-coordinates in Gr(4,8) that respectively carve out an eight-orbit and a four-orbit of the dihedral group. In these variables the $\text{Li}_1$ parts of these functions can be diagonalized, giving rise to the Bose-symmetric representations
\begin{align}
{}^4 Y_8 &= \sum_{i=1}^8 \bigg[ \text{Li}_2 \left( - \mathfrak{X}_{i,8} \right) + \frac12 \text{Li}_2 \left(- \mathfrak{X}_{i,4}  \right) + \frac14 \text{Li}_1\left(- \mathfrak{X}_{i,4} \right)^2 \bigg], \\
{}^3 Y_8 &= \sum_{i=1}^8 \bigg[ \text{Li}_2 \left( - \mathfrak{X}_{i,8} \right) + \frac12 \text{Li}_2 \left(- \mathfrak{X}_{i,4}  \right) + \frac12 \text{Li}_1\left(- \mathfrak{X}_{i,8} \right)^2 \bigg].
\end{align}
We emphasize that this is an aesthetically motivated choice; there may exist other more physically (or mathematically) inspired choices that endow ${}^4 {\cal E}_8$ or ${}^3 {\cal E}_8$ with additional desirable properties. Regardless, it can be checked that any realization of ${}^4 Y_8$ or ${}^3 Y_8$ that respects Bose symmetry gives rise to a BDS-like normalized amplitude that satisfies either~\eqref{stein33} or~\eqref{stein44}, while violating all other Steinmann relations (all at the level of the symbol). 

If we want to recover more Steinmann relations, such as those holding between partially overlapping three- and four-particle invariants, we can instead define BDS-like ans\"atze that depend only on subsets of the three- or four-particle invariants. In particular, it proves possible to decompose the BDS ansatz into either
\begin{align}
{\cal A}_8^{\text{BDS}}(\{\mand{i,\dots,i+k}\}) &= {}^{{\{a,b\}}_4} {\cal A}_8^{\text{BDS-like}}(\{\mand{i,i+1}\}, \{\mand{i,i+1,i+2,i+3} | i \in \{a,b\} \})  \label{bds_like_4q} \\ 
&\hspace{5.6cm} \times \exp \left[ - \frac{\Gamma_{\text{cusp}}}{4}\ {}^{{\{a,b\}}_4} Y_{8}(\{u_i\})  \right], \nonumber  \\
{\cal A}_8^{\text{BDS}}(\{\mand{i,\dots,i+k}\}) &= {}^{{\{a,b\}}_3} {\cal A}_8^{\text{BDS-like}}(\{\mand{i,i+1}\}, \{\mand{i,i+1,i+2} | i \in \{a,b\} \})  \label{bds_like_3q} \\ 
&\hspace{5.6cm} \times \exp \left[ - \frac{\Gamma_{\text{cusp}}}{4}\ {}^{{\{a,b\}}_3} Y_{8}(\{u_i\})  \right], \nonumber 
\end{align}
for any $\{a,b\}$ such that $b-a$ is odd.\footnote{The difference $b-a$ should be computed mod 8 in the case of ${}^{{\{a,b\}}_3} {\cal A}_8^{\text{BDS-like}}$ since $\mand{i+8,\dots,i+k+8} = \mand{i,\dots,i+k}$ in general, but should be computed mod 4 in the case of ${}^{{\{a,b\}}_4} {\cal A}_8^{\text{BDS-like}}$ since momentum conservation implies the stronger identity $\mand{i+4,i+5,i+6,i+7} = \mand{i,i+1,i+2,i+3}$ between four-particle invariants.} Any solution to~\eqref{bds_like_4q} defines a BDS-like normalized amplitude $\EfourJ$ that respects the Steinmann relations
\begin{equation}
\begin{rcases}
\text{Disc}_{\mand{j,j+1,j+2}}\left[\text{Disc}_{\mand{i,i+1,i+2,i+3}} \big(\EfourJ \big) \right] \! \! \! \! &= 0, \hspace{.3cm} \\
\text{Disc}_{\mand{i,i+1,i+2,i+3}}\left[\text{Disc}_{\mand{j,j+1,j+2}} \big(\EfourJ \big) \right] \! \! \! \! &= 0, \label{stein34}
\end{rcases} \quad 
\begin{gathered} i \notin \{a,b\}, \\ j \in \{i-2, i-1, i+2, i+3\}, \end{gathered}
\end{equation}
in addition to all the Steinmann relations satisfied by ${}^4 {\cal E}_8$ as given in eq.~\eqref{stein33}. Moreover, it will respect many of the Steinmann relations satisfied by ${}^3 {\cal E}_8$---namely, those that don't involve a discontinuity in either $\mand{a,a+1,a+2,a+3}$ or $\mand{b,b+1,b+2,b+3}$. Similarly, any solution to~\eqref{bds_like_3q} defines an amplitude $\EthreeJ$ that respects

as well as all the Steinmann relations satisfied by ${}^3 {\cal E}_8$ and described in eq.~\eqref{stein44}, and all the relations specified in eq.~\eqref{stein33} that don't involve a discontinuity in either $\mand{a,a+1,a+2}$ or $\mand{b,b+1,b+2}$. Clearly it is not possible for BDS-like amplitudes of either type to be Bose-symmetric; however, it proves possible to construct solutions to~\eqref{bds_like_3q} such that $\EthreeJ$ respects the dihedral flip $s_{i,\dots,i+k} \rightarrow s_{9-i,\dots,9-i-k}$ when this mapping is oriented to map $\mand{a,a+1,a+2}$ and $\mand{b,b+1,b+2}$ between each other. We present specific realizations of ${}^{{\{1,2\}}_4} Y_{8}$ and ${}^{{\{7,8\}}_3} Y_{8}$ in appendix~\ref{appendix:bds_like}. As with the Bose-symmetric normalization choices, it can be checked that all possible realizations of ${}^{{\{a,b\}}_4} Y_{8}$ and ${}^{{\{a,b\}}_3} Y_{8}$ give rise to BDS-like amplitudes that obey and break the same Steinmann relations (for a given pair of indices $a$ and $b$).

{}^{{\{1,2\}}_4} Y_{8} &= {}^{4}Y_8 -

 \begin{align}

where $\overline{\mathfrak{X}}_{i,j}$ is the image of the ${\cal X}$-coordinate $\mathfrak{X}_{i,j}$ under the dihedral flip that sends $Z_i \rightarrow Z_{9-i}$ (that is, the expression in the second square bracket is understood to be the sum of itself and this dihedral image). 


The decompositions~\eqref{bds_like_3}, \eqref{bds_like_4}, and \eqref{bds_like_3q} do not uniquely determine ${}^{3} Y_{8}$, ${}^{4} Y_{8}$, or ${}^{3,j} Y_{8}$. In fact, there exists a 10-dimensional (3-dimensional) space of (Bose-symmetric) solutions for ${}^{3} Y_{8}$, a 36-dimensional (5-dimensional) space of (Bose-symmetric) solutions for ${}^{4} Y_{8}$, and a 3-dimensional space of solutions for ${}^{3,j} Y_{8}$. 
 \begin{align}
{}^{3,1}Y_8 &= {}^{3}Y_8 -
\Big( \text{Li}_1(-\mathfrak{X}_{1, 4}) + \text{Li}_1(-\mathfrak{X}_{2, 4}) + \text{Li}_1(-\mathfrak{X}_{1, 8}) + \text{Li}_1(-\mathfrak{X}_{5, 8}) \Big)  \\
&\hspace{3.4cm} \times \Big( \text{Li}_1(-\mathfrak{X}_{1, 4}) + \text{Li}_1(-\mathfrak{X}_{4, 4}) + \text{Li}_1(-\mathfrak{X}_{4, 8}) + \text{Li}_1(-\mathfrak{X}_{8, 8}) \Big) \nonumber
\end{align}

 \begin{align*}
 &\ \hspace{1.4cm}- \log(s_{\scaleto{1234}{4.4pt}} s_{\scaleto{3456}{4.4pt}}) \log(s_{\scaleto{2345}{4.4pt}} s_{\scaleto{4567}{4.4pt}}) \nonumber
 \end{align*}
 
 \begin{align*}
&\ \hspace{2.4cm}- \frac12 \log(\mand{i,i+1,i+2}) \log\left(\frac{\mand{i,i+1,i+2} \ \mand{i+1,i+2,i+3}^2}{\mand{i+4,i+5,i+6}}\right) \bigg] \nonumber
 \end{align*}
 
 To take full advantage of the Steinmann relations, it is convenient to work in terms of symbol letters that isolate different Mandelstam invariants. There are twelve independent dual conformally invariant cross ratios that can appear in these symbols
\begin{align}
u_1 &= \frac{\mand{12} \mand{4567}}{\mand{123} \mand{812}}, \quad \text{and cyclic (8-orbit)} \\
u_9 &= \frac{\mand{123} \mand{567}}{\mand{1234} \mand{4567}}, \quad \text{and cyclic (4-orbit).}
\end{align}
It is not possible to isolate all three- and four-particle Mandelstam invariants simultaneously into twelve different symbol letters. (More than twelve symbol letters will appear in these amplitudes, but we here restrict our attention to the twelve that will appear in the first entry.) However, different choices of letters can be made such that either all the four-particle invariants, or all the three-particle invariants, are isolated.

One choice that isolates the four-particle invariants is
\begin{align}
{}^4 d_1 &= u_2 \ u_6 = \frac{\mand{23} \ \mand{67} \ (\mand{1234})^2}{\mand{123} \ \mand{234} \ \mand{567} \ \mand{678}}, \quad \text{and cyclic (4-orbit)} \\
{}^4 d_5 &= u_2/u_6 = \frac{\mand{23} \ \mand{567} \ \mand{678}}{\mand{67} \ \mand{123} \ \mand{234}}, \quad \text{and cyclic (4-orbit)} \\
{}^4 d_9 &= u_1 \ u_2 \ u_5 \ u_6 \ u_9^2 = \frac{\mand{12} \ \mand{23} \ \mand{56} \ \mand{67}}{\mand{234} \ \mand{456} \ \mand{678} \ \mand{812}}, \quad \text{and cyclic (4-orbit)}.
\end{align}
In this alphabet ${}^4 d_1, {}^4 d_2, {}^4 d_3$, and ${}^4 d_4$ each contain a different four-particle Mandelstam invariant, while the other letters only involve two- and three-particle invariants. The extended Steinmann relations then tell us that ${}^4 d_1, {}^4 d_2, {}^4 d_3$, and ${}^4 d_4$ can never appear next to each other in the symbol of ${}^4 A^{\text{BDS-like}}_{8}$ (but each can still appear next to themselves).

Similarly, we can isolate the three-particle invariants by choosing
\begin{align}
{}^3 d_1 &= \frac{u_1 \ u_2 \ u_4 \ u_7}{u_3 \ u_5 \ u_6 \ u_8 \ u_9^2} = \frac{\mand{12} \ \mand{23} \ \mand{45} \ \mand{78} \ (\mand{1234})^2 \ (\mand{4567})^2}{\mand{34} \ \mand{56} \ \mand{67} \ \mand{81} \ (\mand{123})^2}, \quad \text{and cyclic (8-orbit)} \\
{}^3 d^4_9 &= u_1 \ u_5 \ u_9 \ u_{12} = \frac{\mand{12} \ \mand{56}}{\mand{1234} \ \mand{3456}}, \quad \text{and cyclic (4-orbit)},
\end{align}
in which case ${}^3 d_1$ through ${}^3 d_8$ each contain a different three-particle Mandelstam invariant, as well as four-particle Mandelstams that they don't partially overlap with. The remaining four letters only contain two- and four-particle invariants. In these letters, conditions~\eqref{stein34_5} and~\eqref{stein34_6} tell us that ${}^3 d_7, {}^3 d_8, {}^3 d_2$, and ${}^3 d_3$ can never appear next to ${}^3 d_1$ in the symbols of ${}^{3} {\cal E}_8$ or ${}^{3,j} {\cal E}_8$ (plus the cyclic images of this statement). Moreover, conditions~\eqref{stein34_1} through~\eqref{stein34_4} give us the additional restrictions that none of ${}^3 d_1, {}^3 d_5, {}^3 d_9$ and ${}^3 d_{10}$ can ever appear next to ${}^3 d_3, {}^3 d_4, {}^3 d_7,$ or ${}^3 d_8$ in the symbol of ${}^{3,1} {\cal E}_8$ (analogous relations hold for the other ${}^{3,j} {\cal E}_8$). These are the restrictions given by the Steinmann relations involving $\mand{1234}$ and one of $\mand{781}, \mand{812}, \mand{345}$, or $\mand{456}$. The other Steinmann relations between three- and four-particle invariants will not be respected by ${}^{3,1} {\cal E}_8$, since ${}^{3,j} {\cal A}^{\text{BDS-like}}_{8}$ depends on $\mand{2345}, \mand{3456},$ and $\mand{4567}$.
